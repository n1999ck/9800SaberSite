                State University has turned its attention towards
                the environment. Dr. Frank Brown has recently
                formed a new recycling project committee as of
                this year which will be chaired by Maria Holmes. <br>
                Holmes is the Director of Auxiliary Services and
                will be the head of a committee consisting of
                seven other members. These members are Dr. George
                Panos, Dr. Bill Birkhead, Dr. Kevin Peterson,
                Cindy Weeks, and Steven Schmidt. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;Right now our goal is to
                begin educating the faculty, staff and students
                about why we should recycle,&#148; says Holmes. </strong></font></p>
                <p><font size="4"><strong>The recycling effort is
                founded upon four basic principles which are
                known as the 4 R&#146;s. The 4 R&#146;s are
                Recycle, Reduce, Reuse and Respect using
                education as the force behind them. </strong></font></p>
                <p><font size="4"><strong>Holmes explains, &#147;We
                are also looking at what other universities in
                the State of Georgia are doing with their
                recycling projects.&#148; Maria continues by
                stating, &#147;as we begin to educate people, we
                will be working on more visible projects such as
                recycling bins and shredders, working with
                housing and food services and office areas to cut
                down on the use of items that can&#146;t be
                recycled.&#148; </strong></font></p>
                <p><font size="4"><strong>The committee plans to
                educate the faculty, staff and students by
                putting an article in the Saber each week,
                placing interesting tidbits about recycling on
                the public notice board and having some programs
                that tie in with the National Recycling
                Organization. </strong></font></p>
                <p><font size="4"><strong>Experience is a key
                factor as well since many of the committee
                members do their own recycling of paper they use
                while at work in their offices. </strong></font></p>
                <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;I&#146;m very
                pleased that the committee members are very
                interested in recycling&#148;, says Holmes. </strong></font></p>
                <p><font size="4"><strong>Education is both the
                lifeblood of this program that is being
                established here at CSU and the mission of this
                committee. </strong></font></p>
                <p><font size="4"><strong>According to the
                committee, &#147;Education is the life force. We
                can develop an elaborate recycling set-up, but
                without the education, the system will never
                reach its potential. Several universities,
                including Cornell, found that recycling increased
                significantly and that contamination decreased
                dramatically after an education program was
                introduced to complement the recycling system.
                This is what we hope to see at CSU.&#148; </strong></font></p>
