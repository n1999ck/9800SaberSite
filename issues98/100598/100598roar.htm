                else is having a problem with being overloaded by
                our professors. I know that semester conversion
                has been hard for the whole school, but come on!
                Give us a break after the hell that we went
                through to get these classes! And now the
                professors are trying to kill us with work.
                Students taking a full load have between four and
                six classes. When you are trying to juggle that
                many classes going at the rate of quarters, life,
                work and what ever else - you have no time to
                breath. All that I have heard since I came here
                is &quot;get involved.&quot; Who has the time? I
                know that at this pace I will not take a full
                load again which means that I wont graduate on
                time (I was told that Semesters were going to
                help us graduate on a 4 year track - not me.) </strong></font></p>
