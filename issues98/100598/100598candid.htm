                talented students here at Columbus State
                University. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>Abel is a
                new incoming freshman who came to CSU from
                LaGrange, Georgia. He is a graduate of the class
                of 1998 from Troup High School in LaGrange, GA
                and is currently an art major here at CSU. </strong></font></p>

                that he chose Columbus State for its Art program.

                has only been here for a short while, he has only
                experienced a few things. </strong></font></p>

                mentions, &quot;There are people from all walks
                of life here at CSU. This is much different than
                the groups you hang out with in high
                school.&quot; </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>Abel
                enjoys doing a lot of different things in his
                spare time. His hobbies include playing the
                guitar and being associated with music in
                general. He also enjoys drawing, naturally, since
                he has been doing it since he was a little kid
                and is also currently an art major. </strong></font></p>
