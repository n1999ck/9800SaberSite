    <td><font size="4"><strong>The Columbus State Lady Cougar softball team continued their
    solid play as the women swept two games from conference foe Lander University recently. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Boosted by awesome pitching from Nathalie Fradette(12-3), the Lady
    Cougars battled Lander until the 11th inning in game one before pulling out a 1-0 victory.
    Although Fradette dominated Lander, the Lady Cougars could not get the bats going to
    produce the runs. Fradette herself was the offensive juggernaut that put Columbus over the
    edge. Going 3-for-5 at the plate with a double and a stolen base, it was her third hit of
    the day that allowed her to score the winning run in the 11th inning. Besides collecting
    three of CSU&#146;s five hits, Fradette pitched all 11 innings, giving up no runs and just
    three hits.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>Game two saw an equally impressive pitching performance as
    Carrie Newton shut down the Lady Senators in seven innings, allowing just five hits and
    striking out five as CSU won 4-0. Julie Garcia and Merri Anne McCall each went 2-for-3
    with an RBI at the plate for Columbus. With the victory, Newton ran her record to (14-2).</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>The sweep of Lander was the fifth and sixth consecutive
    victories for Columbus after coming off a disappointing spring break tournament at the
    South Commons Complex. </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>The tournament, being hosted by the Lady Cougars, consisted of
    10 teams from Division II. After losing the opener to Carson-Newman, Columbus rallied to
    defeat the Mississippi College for Women 2-1. The second day saw Columbus State lose both
    of it&#146;s games, first to Eckerd College 4-1, and then to instate rival Valdosta 2-0.<br>
    After the tournament, head coach Judy Favor wasn&#146;t afraid to let it be known how
    disappointed she was in her team. &#147;I&#146;ve never had a team go 1-3 in a tournament,
    especially one with this much talent, stated Favor. </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>Following the tournament, Favor challenged her team to play with
    more intensity. It apparently worked as the Lady Cougars rattled off six straight
    victories. With the sweep of Lander, CSU ran their record to 26-5, 6-0 in Peach Belt play.</strong></font></td>
