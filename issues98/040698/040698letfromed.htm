        <td><font size="4"><strong>The time is nearing for me to
        say good bye to the Saber. Although I hate to see it go,
        I know it is time to move on and pass the torch to the
        next unsuspecting victim. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>The Saber has offered long hours and
        frustrating moments, but it has offered me many more good
        times than bad.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>There is a certain satisfaction
        in this job. Developing an idea, putting on paper and
        watching it grow, is something everyone should experience
        at least once in life. At the Saber, I&#146;ve had a
        chance to learn from my mistakes and keep going.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The Saber has afforded me the
        opportunity to meet many people on campus. The members of
        the Saber staff are lifelong friends. The memories
        I&#146;ve gathered in this office are the ones I will
        carry with me and look back on as the good old days of my
        college career. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I covered a radical
        preacher&#146;s sermon on campus, the relocation of
        several friendly gopher tortoises, the Georgia College
        Press Association awards in Macon, the Peachbelt
        Leadership Conference in Augusta, and Vice President Al
        Gore&#146;s visit to campus over the last year.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Since the campus is growing,
        I&#146;m sure the next editor will enjoy and endure even
        more exciting times. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The Saber is the epitome of a
        group of people coming together to create something
        useful and fun. Ever week is a new challenge, it is
        starting all over again. But every week is also a new
        accomplishment filled with congratulations and kudos for
        a job well done.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I know the next editor will
        share my enthusiasm for this paper and the school it
        represents. </strong></font></p>
