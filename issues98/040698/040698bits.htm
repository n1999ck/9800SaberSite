    <tr>
        <td><font size="4"><strong>Van Halen made their debut
        with a new lead singer, Gary Cherone, over spring break. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Cherone, former frontman for the band
        Extreme, does an excellent job on the album, Van Halen 3.
        Cherone&#146;s vocals are near perfect, and at times
        actually sound like a mixture of former Van Halen voices
        David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Despite the extraordinary
        performance from Cherone, the album just does not live up
        to Van Halen standards. Eddie Van Halen, Alex Van Halen,
        Michael Anthony and Gary Cherone simply failed to produce
        a good album. Van Halen 3 does, however, include a
        standout hit, &#147;Without You&#148;. After listening to
        this album and albums from the recent past, one must
        wonder if the big Hagar/Van Halen split was the right
        move for Van Halen.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Just months after the split,
        Hagar released his new album, Marching To Mars. The Hagar
        album was evidence enough that Sammy Hagar does not need
        Van Halen to produce good music. On the other hand, Van
        Halen is a band with a definite identity crisis.
        Hopefully the future will tell differently, but Gary
        Cherone&#146;s talent is being wasted with Van Halen. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Stone Temple Pilots frontman
        Scott Weiland released his first solo album last week.
        The album, 12 Bar Blues, showcases Weiland&#146;s lyrical
        and vocal talents, but doesn&#146;t pack the punch that
        was originally reported. The standout track from the
        album is &#147;Mockingbird Girl&#148;, a new version of
        the song that was originally on the Tank Girl soundtrack.
        </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Talk Show, the band made up of
        Stone Temple Pilots members, minus Scott Weiland, have
        apparently fired their lead singer, Dave Coutts. Dean
        DeLeo, Robert DeLeo, and Erik Kretz have not given a
        reason for the firing of Coutts, but have only stated
        that they would look for a new voice for Talk Show. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Here is an idea, how about
        getting Scott Weiland and calling yourself Stone Temple
        Pilots? </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>When the two sides are divided
        the outcome is two mediocre albums. When the two sides
        join together the outcome is one good album. The solution
        seems simple enough, but we will have to wait and see. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Stone Temple Pilots are
        scheduled to record together again in 1999. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Fans of the band Matchbox 20
        should enjoy the new release by a band called
        Tabitha&#146;s Secret. Both bands have Rob Thomas on
        vocals, and both share the same musical sound. The
        Tabitha&#146;s Secret album is called Don&#146;t Play
        with Matches, and contains acoustic and demo versions of
        the Matchbox 20 hit, &#147;3 AM&#148;. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The set list for Don&#146;t
        Play With Matches is as follows: &#147;3 AM&#148;,
        &#147;Forever December&#148;, Here Comes Horses&#148;,
        &#147;Paint Me Blue&#148;, &#147;Dear Joan&#148;,
        &#147;High&#148;, &#147;Unkind&#148;, &#147;Jesus Was an
        Alien&#148;, &#147;Tired&#148;, &#147;Swing&#148;, and
        alternate versions of &#147;3AM&#148; and &#147;Forever
        December&#148;. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Semisonic released their second
        album, Feeling Strangely Fine, last week. This album is a
        follow up and very similar to their 1996 album, Great
        Divide. I recommend getting the both albums if you do not
        have them already. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Semisonic is Dan Wilson, John
        Munson, and Jacob Slichter. Feeling Strangely Fine
        showcases several radio-friendly songs, such as
        &#147;Closing Time&#148; and &#147;Singing In My
        Sleep&#148;. Wilson and company are comparable in sound
        to Our Lady Peace and Tonic. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>On the local front,
        Drivin&#146; n&#146; Cryin&#146; will perform here on
        campus Thursday night. The band released it&#146;s self
        titled and seventh album late last year. Drivin&#146;
        n&#146; Cryin&#146; are Kevin Kinney on vocals, Jeff
        Sullivan on drums, and Tim Nielson on bass. The Atlanta
        based trio have sold over one million albums during their
        twelve year career. Drivin&#146; n&#146; Cryin&#146;
        released their first album, &#147;Scarred but
        Smarter&#148;, in 1986. &#147;Whisper Tames The
        Lion&#148; followed in 1988. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The band brought us
        &#147;Mystery Road&#148; in 1989, which included the
        still popular song &#147;Straight To Hell.&#148;
        &#147;Fly Me Courageous&#148; was released in 1991, and
        &#147;Smoke&#148; was released in 1993. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The band gave us the album
        &#147;Wrapped In Sky&#148; in 1995. The latest effort
        from the trio came in 1997, and as previously stated, is
        called &#147;Drivin N Cryin.&#148; The track listing for
        the album is as follows: &#147;Keepin&#146; It Close To
        My Heart&#148;, &#147;Roof Garden&#148;, &#147;I&#146;ve
        Got A Message&#148;, &#147;Drivin&#146; n&#146;
        Cryin&#146;&#148;, &#147;Around The Long Way&#148;,
        &#147;Let Lenny B&#148;, &#147;Paid In Full&#148;,
        &#147;Everything&#146;s Gonna Be Alright&#148;,
        &#147;Beneath The Undertow&#148;, &#147;Passing
        Through&#148;, &#147;Leaving On A Jet Plane&#148;, and
        &#147;Nothin&#146; to Lose&#148;. &#147;Everything&#146;s
        Gonna Be Alright&#148; is the new single. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;Leaving On A Jet
        Plane&#148; is the first cover song to ever appear on a
        Drivin&#146; n&#146; Cryin&#146; album, and is also the
        first song that Kevin ever learned to play. He learned
        the song at the age of fifteen from his &#147;John Denver
        easy Guitar Book.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Tickets are only $5.00, and
        that is a steal considering the show they put on. </strong></font></p>
