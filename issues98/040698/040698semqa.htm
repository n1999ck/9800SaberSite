        <td><font size="4"><strong>Semester conversion is drawing
        near. In the fall of 1998, Columbus State University will
        begin the academic year on the semester system. The
        following list addresses some commonly asked questions
        about semester conversion and how it will effect
        students.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Q:
        What is the difference between a quarter and a semester
        system?<br>
        A: A semester system divides the school year into three
        10-week periods, plus a 9 week summer session. The
        semester system divides the year into fall and spring
        semesters, each 15 weeks, plus a 7 week summer session.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Q: What are the advantages of a
        semester calendar for the student?<br>
        A: The main academic advantage is that the pace of a
        semester course is less hectic. The student will have
        more time to absorb course material and work on projects.
        About 65% of the colleges and universities in the United
        States use the semester system.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Q: Will the credit value of
        courses change on the semester system?<br>
        A: On the quarter system, most courses are five credit
        hours and meet five hours per week. On<br>
        the semester system most courses are three credit hours
        and meet three hours per week.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Q: What is a typical semester
        course load?<br>
        A: On the quarter system most students take three
        5-credit-hour courses per quarter or 9<br>
        courses per year. On the semester system students usually
        take five 3-credit-hour courses per semester or about 10
        courses per year.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Q: How many credits will be
        required for graduation?<br>
        A: Most majors will require 120 academic semester credits
        plus physical education; none will<br>
        require more than 128 semester credits plus physical
        education. To earn a bachelor&#146;s degree on the
        quarter system, students must complete a minimum of 180
        credits with at least a 2.0 grade point average. On
        semesters that requirement becomes a minimum of 120
        academic credits with at least a 2.00 grade point
        average.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Q: Will it take longer to
        graduate?<br>
        A: Probably not. Current students will graduate as
        planned, provided they do not change majors.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Q: How will credit hours
        convert?<br>
        A: Quarter credits earned for a degree will be multiplied
        by two thirds to convert them to semester credit.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Q: How will the change to
        semester affect the students&#146; grade point average?<br>
        A: The student&#146;s grade point average will not change
        because of the conversion to the semester system. Hours
        attempted and hours earned will be multiplied by
        two-thirds to convert them to semester credits.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Q: How many credits will be
        required for full-time status?<br>
        A: Full-time status will remain at 12 credit hours for
        undergraduate students. To graduate in four years a
        student needs to satisfactorily complete a minimum of 15
        credit hours of degree<br>
        requirements each semester. Full-time status for graduate
        students will change to 9 credit hours.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Q: How will the number of
        credits determine classification on the semester system?<br>
        A: The new semester classifications require fewer
        credits: </strong></font></p>
        <ul>
            <li><font size="4"><strong>Freshman: Fewer than 30
                credits </strong></font></li>
            <li><font size="4"><strong>Sophomore: 30-59 credits </strong></font></li>
            <li><font size="4"><strong>Junior: 60-89 credits</strong></font></li>
            <li><font size="4"><strong>Senior: 90 credits and
                above.</strong></font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Q: How will the change to
        semesters affect tuition? Will it cost more to go to CSU?<br>
        A: The yearly tuition will not change as a result of the
        conversion to semesters. A student will be paying for two
        semesters instead of three quarters (two payments instead
        of three).</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Q: How will the change to
        semesters affect financial aid?<br>
        A: Financial aid recipients should notice no change to
        the amount of financial aid awarded. Cost of attendance
        figures and yearly award amounts should remain the same,
        but will be divided into two semesters instead of three
        quarters.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Q: If a student begins on
        quarters and finishes on semesters, will they lose
        credits? How will their credits be converted?<br>
        A: Credits will convert on a two-thirds ratio. For
        example, if the student earned 45 credits on quarters,
        that will convert to 30 credits on semesters. The student
        will not lose any credits. Credits earned on the quarter
        system will be converted to semester credits. All
        advance-placement credits and transfer credits will be
        converted from quarters to the semester system on a
        two-thirds ratio.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Q: If a quarter system course
        is phased out or no longer required on the semester
        system, will the credits earned in that course still
        count toward graduation?<br>
        A: Yes. The student&#146;s advisor will determine the
        semester functional equivalent of those courses that have
        been phased out.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Q: How can a student retake a
        course on the semester system after failing it on the
        quarter system?<br>
        A: If a student needs to repeat a course taken on the
        quarter system, an accepted semester substitute will be
        specified in the chart.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Q: If on the quarter system the
        student has started taking courses in their major
        program, do they have to change to the semester system
        degree requirements for their major?<br>
        A: That depends on when the student started and plans to
        finish:</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&gt;&gt; If the student will
        complete graduation requirements after December 1997,
        he/she will be given the opportunity to satisfy Area II
        and Area III of the core as follows:</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>* Area II: Any two laboratory
        science courses in lieu of the laboratory science
        sequence <br>
        requirement. The student must still satisfy course
        prerequisites for other science courses.<br>
        * Area III: POS 105 and either HIS 105, 106, or 117, and
        any two social science courses approved for Area III.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&gt;&gt; If a student will
        complete graduation requirements Fall 1998 or after,
        he/she will have the<br>
        option of using semester courses to satisfy the quarter
        system degree requirements, or the option of switching to
        the new semester system requirements. Faculty advisors
        and Registrar personnel will assist the student in
        determining the best choice, given the requirements the
        student has left. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Q: If the student is in the
        middle of a two- or three-quarter sequence of courses,
        how will they complete it on the semester system?<br>
        A: Whenever possible, students should complete all
        sequences begun on the quarter system before the
        conversion to the semester system. For example, some
        three-course sequences on the quarter system will become
        two-course sequences on the semester system. There could
        be repetition or gaps of information if a student starts
        a sequence on the quarter system but finishes it on the
        semester system. If the student has started a sequence on
        the quarter system, he/she should try to finish it on the
        quarter system.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Q: What can the student do to
        plan for semester conversion?<br>
        A: First, if the student is close to graduation he/she
        should try to complete all requirements on the quarter
        system. Second, if the student cannot finish on quarters,
        complete all sequences on the quarter system.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Q: How can the student obtain
        more information about the semester conversion?<br>
        A: The student can ask their advisor or the chair of the
        department of their major. They can also visit the CSU
        website (www.colstate.edu), where new information will be
        posted regularly. Beginning this spring the student
        should see the schedule of all quarter system courses CSU
        plans to offer between now and Fall 1998. At this time
        you can also contact Dr. Barbara Hunt of the Department
        of Language and Literature at 568-2054, or you can send
        her an e-mail here on campus. However, at the end of
        March Dr. Hunt will move her office to Arnold 126 to
        assume the position of Assistant Dean of University
        College effective July 1, 1998. </strong></font></p>
