        challenges and obstacles everyday that could change our
        lives forever. This was recently discovered by a group of
        students from Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peters,
        Minnesota. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong><img src="040698minnesota.jpg" align="left" hspace="0" width="313" height="230"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>After
        arriving to Columbus, Ga.to work on a Habitat for
        Humanity project, they were informed that their hometown
        and campus was damaged severely by a tornado. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Of the eight groups sent from
        Gustavus Adolphus College, this is the only group that
        stayed to finish their Habitat project. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The students were greatly
        appreciative of the response and attention they received
        after the devastation that both they and their hometown
        encountered. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The group of students spent
        their Spring Break helping with a Habitat for Humanity
        project. Seven other groups also helped with the project.
        </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Bert Powell, Site Supervisor
        says, &#147;The Collegiate Challenge gives groups a good
        program for spring break. As an alternative to a fling at
        the beach, I admire their sense of ambition for giving up
        the beach and they should be commended for sticking with
        it after the damage that has been done. It is good that
        our community has pitched in to help their morale by
        giving them entertainment as well as other stuff.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>One Minnesota student says,
        &#147;We are not sure what we have left to go home to.
        Some of us found out that they have nothing left, some
        found out that everything is fine, and some know
        nothing.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Columbus State University
        showed their Southern hospitality by opening up the use
        of their phones, internet services and televisions for
        the students. Other contributors in the Columbus
        community aided the Minnesota students as well. </strong></font></p>

        Hair Salon, Toms Coke/Pepsi, Bookstore, Hollywood
        Connection, Health Clinic, Dental Hygiene, Student
        Government Association and other anonymous contributors
        helped the students by donating clothing, entertainment
        and meals. </strong></font></p>

        Adolphus College student, says, &#147;I can&#146;t

        us. We never expected anything like this.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The students from Gustavus
        Adolphus college are very appreciative of the services
        that were offered to them. As a result of this incident,
        Columbus State University is in the process of building a
        program to welcome all habitat students in the future.</strong></font></p>
