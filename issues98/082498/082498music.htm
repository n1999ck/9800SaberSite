        <td><font size="4"><strong>Liz Phair hit the stores last
        week with her first album in four years. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>The new album, &#147;WhiteChocolate-SpaceEgg&#148;,
        is not much of a departure from the other Liz Phair
        material, but shows a bit more variety and growth than
        her previous albums. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong><img src="liz.jpg" align="left" hspace="0" width="264" height="355"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>I think this is a good album, and worth
        picking up next time you go shopping. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The set list is as follows:
        &#147;White Chocolate Space Egg,&#148; &#147;Big Tall
        Man,&#148; &#147;Perfect World, &#147;Johnny Feelgood,&#148;
        &#147; Polyester Bride,&#148; &#147; Love Is Nothing,&#148;
        &#147;Baby Got Going,&#148; &#147;Uncle Alvarez,&#148;
        &#147;Only Son,&#148; &#147;Go On Ahead,&#148; &#147;Headache,&#148;
        &#147;Ride,&#148; &#147;What Makes You Happy,&#148;
        &#147;Fantasize,&#148; &#147;Shitloads Of Money,&#148;
        and &#147;Girls&#146; Room.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dishwalla is back with their
        follow-up album to their 1995 release, &#147;Pet Your
        Friends.&#148; The new album is called &#147;And You
        Think You Know What Life&#146;s About.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dishwalla is Scott Alexander,
        Rodney Browning-Cravens, George Pendergast, J.R.
        Richards, and Jim Wood. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>This album has several
        potential hits and has an overall better sound to it than
        their previous projects. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The set list for the album is
        as follows: &#147;Stay Awake,&#148; &#147;Once In a
        While,&#148; &#147;Bottom of the Floor,&#148; &#147;Healing
        Star,&#148; &#147;Until I Wake Up,&#148; &#147;5 Star
        Day,&#148; &#147;Truth Serum,&#148; &#147;So Blind,&#148;
        &#147;Gone Upside Down,&#148; &#147;So Much Time,&#148;
        &#147;The Bridge Song,&#148; and &#147;Pop Guru.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The new Culture Club album is
        out is stores and is excellent. It is a double album,
        featuring their VH1 Storytellers performance and a &#147;Greatest
        Moments&#148; cd. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I will have a more detailed
        description of this album, the story behind it, and the
        band next week.<br>
        I would also recommend to anyone that has not already
        done so, to pick up Third Eye Blind&#146;s album and
        anything by Our Lady Peace. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I had a chance to catch their
        show at The Fox in Atlanta last week and it was awesome.
        Eve6 was the first band out, but I was running late and I
        missed them. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>It was my second time watching
        Our Lady Peace and they were excellent. They ran through
        most of their hits, including &#147;Starseed,&#148;
        &#147;Superman&#146;s Dead,&#148; &#147;4am,&#148; and
        &#147;Clumsy.&#148; They closed out their set with the
        late Jeff Buckley song &#147;Eternal Life.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Third Eye Blind was very
        impressive. I had not wanted to stay and watch their
        show, but the guy I was with convinced me to stay for a
        few songs, and I was hooked. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>We stayed the entire show, and
        they were great. Running down a highlight list is
        impossible, because they played everything they had, a
        new song called &#147;Gorgeous,&#148; and even played The
        Who&#146;s &#147;Baba O&#146;Riley.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Our Lady Peace has dropped off
        the tour to take a break and then begin working on a new
        album, but Third Eye Blind and Eve6 are still on the
        road. If you get a chance to catch this show, I highly
        recommend it.</strong></font></p>
