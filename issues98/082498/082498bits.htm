        <td><font size="4"><strong>Former Van Halen frontman
        Sammy Hagar has just finished taping an episode of the
        television show &#147;Nash Bridges&#148; in San
        Francisco, which according to several sources, is his
        acting debut. He played a bartender, a role he plays
        frequently at his club, the Cabo Wabo Cantina in Cabo San
        Lucas, Baja California.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong><img src="Sammy.jpg" align="right" hspace="0" width="311" height="338"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>Hagar
        held a live show at his Cantina late last month to test
        some of his new material and to finalize the cover for
        his upcoming new album, &#147;Red Voodoo.&#148; The album
        will be his second solo project since leaving Van Halen,
        and is due out in January.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Marilyn Manson will show the
        world his new sound, and his new glam look at this
        year&#146;s MTV Video Music Awards on September 10 in Los
        Angeles.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Manson&#146;s new album, the
        much anticipated &#147;Mechanical Animals&#148;, is set
        to hit stores on September 15. Manson has finished
        shooting the first video from the album, for the song
        &#147;Dope Show.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Regardless that the release
        date is set and plans are being finalized, the project
        has hit a few bumps in the road. Retail stores Wal-Mart
        and K-Mart have refused to sell the album as long as it
        has its current cover art, which depicts Marilyn Manson
        dressed up to look like a stripped-down doll with
        prosthetic breasts. Manson&#146;s record label,
        Interscope Records, is currently working on an
        alternative cover that would cover Manson&#146;s breasts.
        </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The set list for the album is
        as follows: &#147;Great Big White World&#148;, &#147;The
        Dope Show&#148;, &#147;Mechanical Animals&#148;,
        &#147;Rock Is Dead&#148;, &#147;Disassociative&#148;,
        &#147;The Speed Of Pain&#148;, &#147;Posthuman&#148;,
        &#147;I Want To Disappear&#148;, &#147;I Don&#146;t Like

        &#147;Fundamentally Loathsome&#148;, &#147;The Last Day
        On Earth&#148; and &#147;Coma White.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>A new video is in the works for
        Pearl Jam. The band confirmed that they had collaborated
        on a new video for &#147;Do The Evolution,&#148; its
        first since 1992&#146;s &#147;Jeremy,&#148; with Todd
        McFarlane, artist and creator of the &#147;Spawn&#148;
        comic book series.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;We are challenged to
        expand the meaning of our work, and by utilizing this
        visual medium and working with a visionary like Todd, we
        were able to further explore some of the themes we
        depicted in the song, &#145;Do the Evolution.&#146;
        Basically, we&#146;ve tried to make a good stoner
        video,&#148; said the bands official statement.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Two weeks ago Pearl Jam
        released a full-length home video, &#147;Single Video
        Theory,&#148; taken from footage of the band rehearsing
        for the Yield Tour.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>A spokesperson for Beck&#146;s
        record label, Geffen Records, confirmed a &#147;Los
        Angeles Times&#148; report that the artist has laid down
        several tracks for his next album. &#147;Mutations&#148;
        will hit stores on October 20. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The possible set list for the
        album is as follows: &#147;Cold Brains,&#148;
        &#147;Nobody&#146;s Fault But My Own,&#148; &#147;Lazy
        Flies,&#148; &#147;Canceled Check,&#148; &#147;We Live
        Again,&#148; &#147;Tropicalia,&#148; &#147;Dead
        Melodies,&#148; &#147;Bottle of Blues,&#148; &#147;O
        Maria,&#148; &#147;Sing It Again,&#148; and
        &#147;Static.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Ol&#146; Dirty Bastard has done
        it again. The Wu-Tang Clan rapper missed another court
        date in Virginia Beach, Virginia, so Judge Robert L.
        Simpson, Jr. issued an order for his arrest without bond.
        </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>When caught by the police, ODB
        will be kept in jail until his next scheduled court
        appearance to make sure that he actually shows up. He was
        scheduled to appear in court on Thursday August 13 on
        shoplifting charges after missing his date on Tuesday
        August 11, allegedly because of bad weather conditions. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>As I reported several weeks
        ago, Ol&#146; Dirty Bastard, a.k.a. Big Baby Jesus,
        a.k.a. Russell Jones, is accused of walking out of a shoe
        store on July 4 with a pair of $50 Nike shoes. He was
        then ordered to appear on July 28 in court, but failed to
        show up for that date as well. It seems that the only
        thing that ODB can show up on time for is a robbery. </strong></font></p>
