        <p><font size="4"><strong>I recently had a disturbing
        experience with the Financial Aid Office here at CSU. It
        all started when I tried to print an invoice simply for
        my class schedule. The new computer invoice we have told
        me that I was not registered. When I approached the
        administration office, I was instructed to report to
        financial aid. I waited in line at the financial aid
        office for over an hour, only to find that they had one
        person assisting students who acted as though every
        question was a burden. I was told that my federal
        financial aid paperwork, which was filed in March, had
        been misplaced and that I would have to file.
        Furthermore, I would have to pay for my classes and would
        be reimbursed after about a twelve week period. I do not
        understand why my paperwork was not filed properly or why
        I could not be assisted further in understanding why I
        would not be receiving the Hope Scholarship when I have a
        3.8 GPA.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I believe it is time for our
        Financial Aid Office to realize that students are the
        reason they have a job and that they should treat us with
        respect.</strong></font></p>
