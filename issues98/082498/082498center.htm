        <td><font size="4"><strong>Columbus State University will
        expand it&#146;s educational opportunities in the fall
        semester with the addition of a new center on campus. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>The Center for International Education
        will begin services in the fall semester with study
        abroad, foreign exchange and internship opportunities for
        students. Dr. Neal McCrillis, Director, has a list of
        goals which he would like to see the center accomplish in
        the upcoming year.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>According to the Mission
        Statement of the Center for International Education, the
        center exists primarily to enrich and broaden the
        understanding of both students and faculty about the
        world. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The new center was created as a
        result of faculty-initiatives in the past. However, in
        the past there have been no coordinated programs for
        internship or study abroad according to Dr. McCrillis. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The Center will function on
        three main objectives. The Center will focus on support
        coordination and dissemination. This will entail the
        coordinating of international programs developed by
        Columbus State University faculty and the distribution of
        information regarding these opportunities. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>A few of the existing programs
        include the Kiryu English Language Institute, study
        abroad programs in Mexico, Spain and St. Petersburg,
        Russia and the Oxford, England summer course. The second
        objective involves initiating new programs. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dr. McCrillis would like to
        begin a Latin American Iminent Scholars program which is
        an Endowed program and an Irish Studies program, which is
        very probable. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The third and final objective
        is to internationalize the curriculum by cultivating a
        more international curriculum across disciplines.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dr. McCrillis states that he
        would like to see the Center create an identity on campus
        as well as in the community as a leader. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dr. McCrillis came to CSU in
        July and is a member of the History faculty as well as
        being the Director of the Center for International
        Education and Chairman of the Mildred Miller Fort Chair
        of International Education. <br>
        He states, &#147; I am really impressed with what the program
        has done so far with funding and the level of activity of
        the faculty with their participation.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The Center for International
        Education hopes to enlighten people about their
        opportunities and provide them with these opportunities
        as well. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dr. McCrillis concludes by
        saying, &#147; In five years I hope the Center for
        International Education has created a solid identity on
        campus and that people will know that the office exists.&#148;</strong></font></p>
