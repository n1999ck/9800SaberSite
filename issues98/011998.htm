        dorms</strong></font><p><font size="4">by Bridgette
        Brumbaugh / Staff Writer</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">A Columbus State University student was
        removed from the dorms after officials found marijuana
        pieces in his room. The incident happened on December 1,
        1997. Jasper Cook, Chief of Public Safety, stated that a
        &quot;911&quot; call was placed about a disturbance in
        dorm room A9. According to Cook the Housing Authority
        entered the apartment and discovered seeds and stems
        belonging to one of the tenants. Cook continued by
        commenting that no charges had been filed against this
        student. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Steve Smitt of the Housing Authority
        says that when he arrived at the scene the police and the
        student were talking in the parking lot. Smitt says he
        then went into the dorm to check for damage and unlocked
        the individual's bedroom <!--webbot bot="ImageMap" rectangle="(28,195) (219,222) mailto:saber@colstate.edu" src="011998/ReaderPoll.gif" align="right" border="0" hspace="0" width="250" height="300" startspan --><MAP NAME="FrontPageMap1"><AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="28, 195, 219, 222" HREF="mailto:saber@colstate.edu"></MAP><a href="../../_vti_bin/shtml.dll/Old_saber_site/issues98/011998.htm/map1"><img src="011998/ReaderPoll.gif" align="right" border="0" hspace="0" width="250" height="300" ismap usemap="#FrontPageMap1"></a><!--webbot bot="ImageMap" endspan i-checksum="49694" --></font><font size="4">door. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Smitt stated, &quot; I saw a bag of
        marijuana on the desk, but I didn't touch it&quot;. He
        then re-locked the door, and told the police what he had
        found. He also mentioned that this was a simple case of
        someone looking out for himself because the person who
        made the &quot;911&quot; call was the student's roommate.
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Larry Kees, assistant vice-president of
        student affairs, said, &quot; If it [marijuana] had been
        found in say, the living room or kitchen, then maybe we
        could have determined who it belonged to and made an
        arrest.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The student that was found with the
        marijuana was not charged with a crime. He was removed
        from the dorms however he remains a student at Columbus
        State University and is facing administrative penalties.
        The reason he was not charged was because the officials
        opened his bedroom door without a warrant. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Cook says, &quot;Based on my
        experience, because it was found in his room and the door
        was locked, it wouldn't have held up in a
        courtroom.&quot; Cook also stated that &quot;We have a
        zero tolerance regarding drugs in the dorms.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Despite the occasional room checks, the
        dorms are still your home. The question is do officials
        have the right to search dorm rooms to look for illegal
        drugs or things against school policy? </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">In Commonwealth v. Neilson, 666 NE 984
        (1996), the issue of university employees upholding
        students' constitutional rights in residence halls was
        tested. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">College officials at a public school in
        Massachusetts left notices of a room check on 4
        roommate's bedroom doors at the residence hall. The
        notice read they were going to search for a cat that was
        rumored to be in their dorm. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">When the officials entered one bedroom,
        they saw a light in the closet and thought it might be a
        fire hazard. When the door was opened the officials found
        2 big marijuana plants along with various items for
        cultivation. The officials called the campus police who
        then seized the illegal items. Neilson was charged with
        illegal possession of marijuana as well as cultivating
        and distributing the herb. Both the district and state
        supreme court suppressed the evidence because a fourth
        amendment violation occurred when the state college
        campus police performed a warrantless search of the
        student's dormitory room. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Citing the Fourth Amendment, defense
        attorney's averted a conviction. The Fourth Amendment
        states, &quot;The right of the people to be secure in
        their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against
        unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be
        violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable
        cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly
        describing the place to be searched, and the persons or
        things to be seized&quot;. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">As for the CSU campus, Cook says,
        &quot;We treat the dorms as if they were your home.&quot;
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">As a result of the Neilson case and
        similar cases, school officials might search your dorm
        and find an illegal substance, but you probably will not
        go to jail if they violate the fourth amendment.
        According to Larry Kees, assistant vice-president of
        student affairs, you will however be removed from the
        dorms and face various other penalties.</font></p>
