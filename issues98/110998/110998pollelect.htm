                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">I
                wish Guy Millner had won because I am a
                Republican. I really got discouraged, though,
                because of all the mud-slinging. I think that
                there should be a rule that the candidates can
                only talk about themselves.<br>

                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Even
                though I volunteered at the Republican
                headquarters, I am satisfied that Barnes will be
                our new governor. Throughout the election, there
                was talk of Millner taking away the H.O.P.E.
                scholarship if he was elected. I am a H.O.P.E.
                recipient and I&#146;m glad the program is going
                to continue.</font></p>

                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">I am
                happy about the results of the election. I had
                more confidence in Barnes to continue the
                H.O.P.E. scholarship. In the last campaign with
                Zell Miller vs. Guy Millner, Millner said that
                there was no hope in H.O.P.E. The future of
                H.O.P.E. is very important to me because I also
                have two daughters in school. As far as the
                national election, I am glad that the Democrats
                gained more seats because they dealt with the
                real bread and butter issues like social
                security, education, and Medicare.</font></p>

                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">I am
                not happy with the results of either the state or
                national elections. I don&#146;t think that the
                Democrats did a good job and I am not happy about
                the Democratic gain of seats. I think Clinton
                will escape much easier now. I am all for getting
                rid of him. He broke the law. I was hoping that
                the Republicans would make a really strong
                showing and set precedence for the next
                presidents. The gain for the Democrats is an
                indication that this country is tired of
                listening to impeachment talk and that people are
                falling for Clinton&#146;s rhetoric. It&#146;s
                disappointing. As far as the governor race,
                Millner had plans that fit better with what I
                think should happen in this state.</font></p>
