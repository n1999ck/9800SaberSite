                Columbus&#146; New Horizons Community Service
                Board Women&#146;s Day Treatment Program,
                L-shaped with white-painted walls, had provided
                minimal visual stimulation, which is vital to the
                well-being of infants and toddlers. Students in
                Columbus State University&#146;s Bachelor of
                Science nursing program identified the
                opportunity for enhancement and recently provided
                an extensive facelift for the room - walls
                painted brightly in primary colors and new toys
                provided through Warren&#146;s Kiddie Shop in the
                Peachtree Mall. Other contributors included the
                March of Dimes ($1,000), Home Quarters (paint),
                Home Depot (painting supplies) and Melinda Newton
                (two &#147;exersaucers&#148;).</font></p>

                Horizon&#146;s Women&#146;s Day Treatment Program
                is committed to helping pregnant or postpartum
                teens eliminate substance abuse and learn to cope
                and live in a high-risk environment.
                Significantly, these teens graduate from high
                school on schedule or attain a GED, and several
                progress to technical school or college. &#147;These
                teens who are pregnant or already have babies
                need tremendous support as they pursue an
                education and workforce entry,&#148; says Julie
                Miles, interim director of the women&#146;s
                program. &#147;We appreciate the work of the
                students who participated in the remodeling.
                &#147;The project represents an extension of the
                &#147;maternal child/community rotation&#148; of
                the students&#146; nursing program.</font></p>
