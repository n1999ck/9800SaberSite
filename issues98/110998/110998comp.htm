                semester, Columbus State University&#146;s (CSU)
                Computer Center is offering workshops designed to
                introduce CSU students to Windows 95 and Office
                97.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Effective
                December 31, 1998, DOS programs and Windows 3. 11
                software will no longer be available via the CSU
                networking system.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Bill
                Johnson, the executive director of Computer
                Information Network Systems, says &#147;This
                shift is required for CSU to keep pace with
                technology in academic and administrative areas.
                Overall Windows 95 and Office 97 are easier to
                deal with.&#148;</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Johnson
                admits that this transition has been difficult
                for him. &#147;The transition hasn&#146;t been
                easy; knowing WordPerfect and now switching to
                Word [Microsoft Word].&#148;</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Johnson
                is concerned because since this transition has
                been difficult for him and some faculty, he is
                sure it is difficult for some students also.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Johnson
                says, &#147;There are still some things I don&#146;t
                know... and I have to go to classes myself.&#148;</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Although
                there are pamphlets and an e-mail on CSU&#146;s
                noticeboard to inform students about CSU&#146;s
                Windows 95 and Office 97 workshops., there has
                been little response.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">According
                to Johnson, &#147;there has been no good success&#148;
                with the number of students signing up for
                classes. At the last computer class offered,
                &#147;30 students signed up, but only 5 showed
                up.&#148;</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">The
                next workshop offered to students is Thursday,
                December 1 from 6-9 p.m. Students can sign up in
                the Computer Center.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Johnson
                says, &#147;We will continue to offer these
                workshops and will try to schedule them
                frequently to allow interested students to be
                prepared for 1999.&#148;</font></p>
