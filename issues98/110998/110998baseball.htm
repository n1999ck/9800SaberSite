                <td bgcolor="#000000"><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">The future looks bright for
                the Columbus State Baseball Team as they finished
                their fall session last Tuesday.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">The
                NCAA allows a 6 week time period in which the
                entire team can combine and work together on
                areas such as hitting, base-running fielding, and
                other team oriented aspects of the game.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">The
                Cougars boast a young, but very talented squad
                with the addition of an unheard of 15 members
                from the freshman class. This, coupled with the
                leadership of 8 seasoned seniors, should give
                this team the balance they need in the spring for
                a push at the Peach Belt conference title.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">&#147;At
                times we looked hungry out there this fall,&#148;
                says head coach Greg Appleton, &#147;we&#146;ll
                have to play hungry in the spring to make up for
                our lack of experience.&#148;</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Appleton
                was quick to stress the importance of his senior
                leadership and their role in the influence of
                this team. &#147;Those eight Seniors have to step
                up and lead this team in the right direction.
                Their influence will be key to the success of
                this team,&#148; says Coach Appleton.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Stand-outs
                in the fall include Seniors Robert Cornett, Tony
                Pierce, and Brad Bender as well as Sophomores
                Luke Large and Rodney Kennedy. Also, every
                Freshman has a chance to see some playing time.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">To
                end the fall session both Assistant Coaches Vince
                Massey and Patrick Collins drafted the CSU
                players and played the annual CSU World Series.
                The outcome was disappointing for the Massey&#146;s
                red team as Coach Collins&#146; blue team
                completed a decisive three game sweep and got the
                right, at least for one day, to be called World
                Champions! </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">No
                playing position has been nailed down so this
                spring should be an exciting time to see where
                the players are placed. This year would be a
                great time for the CSU students to get involved
                and COME SEE SOME GAMES!!!</font></p>
