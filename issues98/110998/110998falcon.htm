                <td bgcolor="#000000"><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">After a devastating 28-3
                loss to the New York Jets a week ago, the Atlanta
                Falcons returned to their winning ways by
                defeating the St. Louis Rams, 35-17.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Chris
                Chandler may have returned, but Jamal Anderson
                was the workhorse. Anderson, who was named NFC
                player of the week, rushed for 172 yards and
                scored three touchdowns. He started his scoring
                with a 9 yard pass reception from Chandler, and
                finished off with a scoring run of 4 and 12 yards
                respectively.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Not
                to be outdone, Chandler finished the day with 236
                yards passing, threw for two touchdowns and one
                interception. Much better than the 207 total
                yards gained against the Jets.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">The
                Atlanta defense helped out by limiting the Rams
                to an average of 3.5 yards per rush and a total
                of 247 yards. Cornelius Bennett led the team with
                7 tackles, followed by Keith Brooking and
                Columbus native Randy Fuller with 4.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">The
                task does not get any easier as the Falcons
                travel to take on New England (5-3), who have
                suffered three recent losses to Denver, the New
                York Jets, and Miami. The Patriots are led by
                quarterback, Drew Bledsoe and former Georgia
                star, Robert Edwards.</font></p>
