                <td bgcolor="#000000"><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">The current rise in student
                organizations is raising a major question. Why?
                Currently, there are fifty-five registered
                organizations on the campus of CSU. Remarkably,
                forty-five of these fifty-five are registered
                through the Student Government Association making
                them able to participate in the SGA Forum as well
                as a campus recognized organization.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Joel
                Judah, president of the Student Government
                Association, mentioned that the increase in
                involvement can be seen over the last couple
                years. He says, &#147;People come to the SGA
                forum who have no reason to come. They just want
                to see what is going on.&#148;</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">The
                curiosity of students is overwhelming, and
                student involvement is on the rise. With more
                organizations comes more people to get involved
                and more students at Columbus State University.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">For
                example, Mr. Judah explained how over twenty
                organizations registered for and actively
                participated in the Halloween Carnival hosted by
                Student Government last weekend. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">&#147;Many
                students attend SGA forums and ask to get
                involved, whether or not there are any offices
                available,&#148; Judah added.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">As
                Columbus State University continues to develop
                its active student body, it continues to grow.
                Eight new organizations have been approved by SGA
                this year alone. There are also many
                organizations that have not yet applied for
                recognition.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">When
                asked the reason for such active participation
                and organizational growth, Mr. Judah replied,&#148;It
                has been helpful to have more students living on
                campus as those students become more involved.
                The desire to be more involved is contagious and
                spreads to those students who are originally from
                Columbus.&#148; </font></p>
