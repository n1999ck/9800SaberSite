                around this town is that there is nothing to do.
                Well, usually there isn&#146;t, but on November
                13 that will change, at least for one night. The
                John Scott Evans Band is going to be playing at
                The Loft on November 13 around 10:00 that
                evening. I spoke with Evans last week and he told
                me about several of the songs that are included
                in the show. A few of the highlights include a
                song he wrote for his mom called &#147;Simple
                Gifts,&#148; a song he wrote for his dad called
                &#147;Missin&#146; You,&#148; and a latin groove
                song that features band members on percussion
                called &#147;Tema De La Banda.&#148; </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Evans
                says that his favorite songs to play are the two
                that are written for his parents. I have not
                gotten a chance to see the band play live yet,
                but I have heard the album, and you won&#146;t be
                disappointed in the music. Drop by the Loft on
                the 13th and check them out. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">The
                John Scott Evans Band features Sean Smith on
                drums, Dave Holland on percussion, Chris McGriff
                on keyboard, Raymond J. Blair on bass, David
                Ragsdale on violin, and John Scott Evans on
                guitar.</font></p>

                Just after piling in multi-platinum sales with
                their debut album, MatchBox20 has begun thinking
                about the second time around. This includes
                developing strategies about dealing with the
                pressure of following up such a successful
                record. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">After
                finishing up their tour this week, frontman Rob
                Thomas told MTV news that the band would
                disappear for a period of time, in order to make
                sure that they did not experience any
                over-exposure. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Quite
                frankly, I think it is too late for that.
                MatchBox20&#146;s debut, &#147;Yourself Or
                Someone Like You,&#148; has hung out for 86 weeks
                on the &#147;Billboard&#148; album charts, and is
                currently at number 35.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">&gt;&gt;
                As I mentioned several weeks ago, George Michael
                was arrested on April 6 in a Beverly Hills park
                for engaging in a sexual act with an undercover
                police officer. Michael sat down with MTV last
                week to chat about this and life in general. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">&#147;What
                can I tell you,&#148; Michael said, &#147;I was
                stupid, it was a stupid thing to do. But I&#146;ve
                never been able to turn down a free meal.
                [Laughs] People have said things to me like,
                &#145;Surely you knew,&#146; or &#145;How could
                you possibly have been so stupid?&#146;&#148; </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">&#147;But
                I&#146;m sorry,&#148; he continued, &#147;the
                fact is there was absolutely no one else in the
                vicinity; whatever the police arrest report says,
                there was no one else in the vicinity. It was
                just me. Well actually it was two undercover
                cops, only I couldn&#146;t see one of them. Two
                undercover cops and a randy pop star, you know
                what I&#146;m saying? So there was no one there.
                So if someone&#146;s waving their genitalia at
                you, you don&#146;t automatically assume they&#146;re
                an officer of the law.&#148;</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Michael
                says his greatest regret about the incident was
                the pain he caused his boyfriend, which is larger
                than any sort of personal embarrassment the
                arrest caused. Actually, Michael&#146;s new
                video, &#147;Outside,&#148; makes fun of the
                whole incident. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">I say
                cut the poor guy some slack. Are you telling me
                you&#146;ve never done that at Cooper Creek or
                Flat Rock Park? Give me a break. And undercover
                cops? What are the odds of that? </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Well,
                regardless of his bad timing in the past, his new
                greatest hits collection, &#147;Ladies &amp;
                Gentlemen: The Best of George Michael,&#148; is
                set to hit stores next week.</font></p>
