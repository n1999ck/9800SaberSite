                back to Earth on November 7, is doing more than
                just taking the famous senator John Glenn into
                space. Its crew is conducting experiments that
                will forever affect mankind.</font></p>

                important, they are part of a larger scale
                project called the International Space Station.
                This is a station being built by the Americans,
                Japanese, Russians, Europeans, and several other
                countries which will be the first permanent human
                habitat in orbit.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">With
                the projected start date of the station being
                January of 1999, Dr. Shawn Cruzen, Assistant
                Professor of Astronomy at Columbus State
                University, said, &#147;By the year 2000, people
                will be living in space.&#148;</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">The
                Discovery has taken parts of this station into
                space to test the affects of the space
                environment on this station. It is also studying
                the affects of space on the elderly. This is
                because the effects of space on astronauts are
                like the effects of aging, There is a loss of
                muscle and bone mass and many other symptoms very
                similar to aging.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">The
                results of these tests on Glenn will help
                determine whether or not the elderly will be able
                to live in space.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">According
                to Dr. Cruzen, the study of Glenn is &#147;One of
                dozens of experiments being conducted.&#148;
                These other tests include experiments to study
                the changes of the sun&#146;s corona, which may
                effect global climate changes, testing the
                effects of the space environment on upgrade
                components for the Hubbell telescope, and testing
                ultraviolet emission not passing through the
                atmosphere.</font></p>
