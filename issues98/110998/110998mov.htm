                <td bgcolor="#000000"><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Part four of our series on
                &#147;What&#146;s Wrong in Entertainment&#148;
                will focus on movies. Now, I know that the number
                of flaws in movies are too numerous to count, so
                we will focus on what I think are the main five.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Flaw
                number one is simple - Brandy has no business
                acting. We tolerated it with the whole &#147;Moesha&#148;
                thing because that was on the WB and no one
                watches that anyway. But putting her in her first
                movie (and we&#146;re not counting that &#147;Cinderella&#148;
                remake with Whitney Houston) &#147;I Still Know
                What You Did Last Summer Part 2, the Search for
                Spock Lives On&#148; is a huge mistake. This
                could lead to OTHER movies and that would simply
                be a bigger waste of film than my Senior Prom
                pictures.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Flaw
                number two (actually the biggest of the group,
                yet not more important than keeping Brandy off
                the big screen) is the repetitive story line for
                summer movies. I know that Hollywood thinks that
                we, the viewing audience, are stupid, but why
                release nine movies about volcanoes, six movies
                about floods, eight movies about tornadoes, and
                twelve movies about meteors/comets in just three
                years? It just doesn&#146;t make any sense. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Flaw
                three has to do with why are we going to see all
                of these repetitive plot movies? I have a
                suggestion for you all- don&#146;t go see them,
                and the studios will get the message. Plus,
                chances are that no matter how horrible the
                natural disaster may be, the star is going to
                save the day in every single one of the movies. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Flaw
                four: Wesley Snipes is a good actor. Why did he
                stop acting? At what point did he decide, &#147;Well,
                I&#146;m hailed by critics and fellow actors as a
                good dramatic actor, women seem to like me in
                those roles, the only other black leading man I&#146;ll
                be competing with is Denzel Washington, so maybe
                I should stick with good dramatic roles instead
                of....nahhhh, I wanna be the black Rambo!&#148; </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Come
                on, Wesley, do us all a favor and act! It is a
                true waste of a fine actor (rent the movie &#147;The
                Waterdance&#148; if you don&#146;t believe me) to
                see you shirtless and killing ninja vampires with
                Kenny Rogers (or whatever). </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Finally,
                flaw number five is to re-stress my disapproval
                of Brandy in a movie. It never should have
                happened. I know that we all want to see Jennifer
                &#147;Love&#148; Hewitt in that tanning bed scene
                of &#147;I Still Know Why Sting&#146;s Real Name
                is Gordon Sumner&#148;, but if we give in and see
                the movie, we risk having to see Brandy again.
                And quite frankly, it&#146;s not worth the
                trade-off.</font></p>
