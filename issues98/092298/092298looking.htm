        announced, with hope voiced that the new campus
        facilities would be ready by Fall &#145;63. Construction
        was expected to begin during October 196 1. The college
        was quickly becoming overcrowded.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Fall &#145;61 enrollment reflected a
        drop of thirty students over Fall &#145;60, with an
        enrollment of only 740. There were 464 freshmen, 201
        sophomores, and 45 unclassified. All applications were
        not approved, but the number was not reported.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>School spirit, or lack of it,
        drew fire in student editorials, along with a lack of
        parking. Removal of parking lot &#147;speedbreakers&#148;
        hailed - how did they get back?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The annual &#147;Harvest Hop&#148;
        dance was packed to overflowing - maybe the school spirit
        editorials did some good. The &#145;63 Homecoming
        featured a basketball game, bonfire, and dance. Susan
        Copeland was crowned queen, but the Rebels went down to
        defeat against the Middle Georgia Wolverines, 113- 10 1.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>A literary magazine, Spectrum,
        was to be published for 1961-62, with Miss Irene Roach
        and Mr. Robert Watkins as advisors.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The basketball team finished
        the season 16-6-0, losing to Armstrong College in the
        first round of the Junior College Tournament in
        Statesboro.</strong></font></p>

        was captured by CC freshman Glenda Davis Hall.</strong></font></p>

        run-off election for the office of president, with Guerry
        Thode, Baker High School graduate taking the honors.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>John L. Quick was named the
        1962 Faculty Cup winner. John had been the 1960-61 SGA
        president and played on the basketball team for two
        years. The class of &#145;62 graduated 30 students June
        10, 1962.</strong></font></p>
