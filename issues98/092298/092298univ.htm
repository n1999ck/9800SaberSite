        <td><font size="4"><strong>It&#146;s time to &#147;take a
        reading&#148; on the quest by Columbus College for
        university status.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Dr.
        Frank Brown said last week a key event will occur within
        the next two or three months that will have significant
        bearing on whether or not the local college gets the nod.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Georgia Southern at Statesboro
        was the first and so far only regional college to gain
        university status, and that was in July, 1990. The next
        in line is Valdosta State, which has a tentative date set
        for July, 1992.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dr. Brown said that right now
        everything hinges on whether or not approval is given to
        Valdosta. This decision should be made within the next
        two or three months. If Valdosta gets the go-ahead,
        Columbus College would be set for mid-summer, 1993.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Across the Chattahoochee River
        in Alabama there are 13 regional schools, all of which
        have university status. That includes Troy State
        University, Troy; Troy State University, Dothan, and Troy
        State University, Montgomery. Livingston University has
        an enrollment of only 1,761, and Troy State, Dothan, only
        1,833. Four others have fewer students than Columbus
        College.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Regional schools in Florida,
        Tennessee, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina
        and Kentucky have university status. Georgia is the only
        exception among Southern states.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The current budget crisis may
        have some bearing on the Valdosta decision, but Dr. Brown
        believes a fund shortage is not all that important.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Of great significance is the
        forth-coming recommendation on Valdosta by Chancellor H.
        Dean Propsp who it is believed is not keen on seeing any
        more regional schools gaining university status for the
        time being. He is said to favor a &#147;hold off&#148;
        attitude.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>A decision on Valdosta by the
        15-member Board of Regents should be made next January or
        February.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Needless to say, a strong
        effort In the Valdosta area has been mounted for
        favorable decision. &#147;We don&#146;t need money, just
        send us the title,&#148; is their cry.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>If Valdosta wins, Columbus
        should definitely be next in line, according to Dr.
        Brown. There&#146;s no a great deal of difference between
        the two schools, he said.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>\The Columbus community,
        including alumni, the Chamber of Commerce, civic groups
        and business have expressed a decisive interest in the
        local college receiving the &#147;recognition It
        deserves,&#148; Dr. Brown said.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>When the &#147;big announcement&#148;
        was made in January, 1989, concerning the possibility of
        university status for Columbus, it was predicted the goal
        would be attained by July, 1993. That hasn&#146;t
        changed.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dr. Brown said that standards
        or criteria for university status are well within reach
        of Columbus College: endowments, graduate offerings,
        library holdings, etc. Dormitories do not figure in the
        requirements.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>It is believed the Chancellor
        does not favor more regional colleges gaining the top
        rank because it would &#147;dilute&#148; Georgia&#146;s
        two &#147;flagships&#148; - Georgia Tech and the
        University of Georgia. Dr. Brown sees little merit in
        this belief. Look at Alabama.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Two from Columbus are on the
        Board of Regents. They are Bill Turner and Don Leebern.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Other regional colleges In line
        for the top title are West Georgia, Albany State and
        Kennesaw State.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dr. Brown said the college is
        pushing for new buildings. Top priority now goes toward a
        performing arts center and an arena or physical education
        complex. Funding, of course, is currently a &#147;real
        problem.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Plans for a data processing
        facility are also on the drawing board. The college is
        currently working with IBM for a grant.</strong></font></p>
