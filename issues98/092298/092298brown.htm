        Brown uses to describe Columbus State University. &#147;So
        much is going on. We&#146;re offering degree programs
        that have never been offered before. We&#146;re reaching
        out to the community and working hard to better serve the
        students.&#148;</strong></font></p>

        couldn&#146;t have come at a better time according to Dr.
        Brown. &#147;The school is expanding. There&#146;s going
        to be a lot of construction going on during the upcoming
        years. It&#146;s good that we can take time to celebrate
        and make plans for the future.&#148;</strong></font></p>

        and good staff support, Dr. Brown hopes that students
