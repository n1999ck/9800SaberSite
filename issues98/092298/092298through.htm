        <td><font size="4"><strong>Walking around campus this
        week I noticed that scattered everywhere are banners and
        notices on the 40th Anniversary for the school. This made
        me start thinking(uh oh). </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Forty years is a long time. A great deal
        has happened in the entertainment business in the past
        several decades. Radio, television, and the movie
        industry have changed and grown in many different ways
        over the years. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Looking back over the extensive
        list of shows and bands that have come and gone over the
        years showed me that many of them have been forgotten and
        sometimes overlooked. Well, not today. This is not going
        to be a great journalistic work or anything of the sorts.
        This is simply a look back at some things that I think
        should not be forgotten. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;Sanford and Son&#148; is
        one of those shows that should be remembered and laughed
        at forever. Many other television shows that have brought
        us through the years fall into that category. Think about
        the classics: &#147;Captain Kangaroo,&#148;
        &#147;MASH,&#148; &#147;Bonanza,&#148; &#147;Little House
        on the Prairie,&#148; &#147;The Land of the Lost,&#148;
        &#147;Sesame Street,&#148; and &#147;Archie Bunker.&#148;
        All of those shows helped to pull television through the
        times when our parents were still just dating each other.
        Now most of our parents are dating again, but not each
        other - that&#146;s a whole other story. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The list goes on. Who can
        forget &#147;My Three Son&#146;s,&#148; and &#147;I Love
        Lucy?&#148; Many people still visit Mr. Rogers&#146;
        neighborhood, and through Nick at Nite we can still enjoy
        the blabbering of Mr. Ed. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Don&#146;t get me wrong, not
        all of the classics are from our parents&#146; time. We
        have our own classics. Don&#146;t deny it, everybody
        freezes on the channel when flipping by and catching a
        glimpse of Zach and the gang on &#147;Saved By The
        Bell.&#148; The show&#146;s a classic.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Don&#146;t forget about Ms.
        Garrett and the girls from &#147;Facts of Life,&#148; or
        Willis and Arnold from &#147;Different Strokes.&#148;
        What kid didn&#146;t want to be Bo or Luke from &#147;The
        Duke&#146;s of Hazzard?&quot; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>There are more. Don&#146;t
        believe me? Here it goes: &#147;Magnum P.I.,&#148;
        &#147;Misfits of Science,&#148; &#147;Cheers,&#148;
        &#147;Knight Rider,&#148; &#147;Hillstreet Blues,&#148;
        &#147;Family Ties,&#148; &#147;Gilligan&#146;s
        Island,&#148; &#147;Silver Spoons&#148;, and &#147;Scooby
        Doo.&#148; I almost left out &#147;Green Acres,&#148;
        &#147;Leave It To Beaver,&#148; &#147;Chips,&#148; and
        &#147;You Can&#146;t Do That On Television.&#148; Oh, and
        DYNOMITE! Who could live without reruns of &#147;Good
        Times?&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>That only touches the tip of
        the massive amount of television shows that have brought
        the entertainment industry to where it is today. The
        90&#146;s brought us shows such as &#147;Quantum
        Leap,&#148; &#147;The Simpsons,&#148;
        &#147;Seinfeld,&#148; &#147;Friends,&#148;
        &#147;ER,&#148; &#147;NYPD Blue,&#148; and
        &#147;Baywatch.&#148; &#147;Beverly Hills 90210,&#148;
        &#147;Melrose Place,&#148; and all the other shows of the
        same topic can thank &#147;21 Jump Street,&#148; and
        &#147;The Heights&#148; for opening the door for that
        type of show.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The same goes for the talk show
        industry. Today's stars are only where they are because
        of the people that were before them. Ed Sullivan started
        the whole shindig back in 1948. He brought millions of
        people together every Sunday night at 8:00 until 1971. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>By the time Sullivan was done,
        Johnny Carson had gotten his show rolling. Carson started
        in the 60&#146;s and finally called it quits in 1992.
        Sullivan and Carson opened the door for Arsenio Hall,
        David Letterman, Jay Leno, and Conan O&#146;Brien. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>There is no telling what star
        will emerge next that will have these mentioned before to
        thank for their success. Personally, I&#146;m hoping
        Arsenio jumps back in the game, but we&#146;ll just have
        to wait and see.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Movie stars are in the same
        boat as the above mentioned hosts. They all have somebody
        that opened the door for them to become popular. Marlon
        Brando opened the door for Robert DeNiro to become as
        cool as he is. Al Pacino did the same for Andy Garcia.
        Over the years we have seen so many great stars, such as,
        Jack Nicholson, Jackie Gleason, Sylvester Stallone, Robin
        Williams, Mel Gibson, Kevin Bacon, Michael Keaton, Sean
        Connery, and Harrison Ford. There are so many more that
        it is impossible to name them all. They are responsible
        for all the movies we grew up with. I mean classics, such
        as the &#147;Godfather &#147; trilogy, the &#147;Police
        Academy&#148; series, and &#147;Revenge of the
        Nerds.&#148; Those are good movies- not like the stuff
        made today.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Music is another avenue that
        has changed a great deal over the years. As far as
        I&#146;m concerned, rock music is the only thing worth
        listening to, and that all started with Buddy Holly in
        the pre-1950 era. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I can&#146;t say that it&#146;s
        gotten better, but the industry has grown. The Beatles,
        Led Zeppelin, the Grateful Dead, Frank Zappa, David
        Bowie, and Eric Clapton - they started it all. Aerosmith,
        Ozzy Osbourne, Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan have been
        constants in the music industry for decades. Duran Duran,
        Madonna, Fleetwood Mac, Poison, REM, Willie Nelson,
        Motley Crue, and Johnny Cash are up there, too. Bachman
        Turner Overdrive, Credence Clearwater Revival, Pink
        Floyd, Steppenwolf, Chuck Berry, U2, Huey Lewis and the
        News, and the B 52&#146;s will forever be credited with
        helping keep rock and roll alive. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Another band that has remained
        a pillar in music over the years is Chicago. Come on,
        what couple hasn&#146;t gotten together or broken up to a
        Chicago song? Did I mention Woodstock? The 1969
        Woodstock, not the lame money hungry 1994 copy. Woodstock
        was not a concert. It was a historical event. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Well, that&#146;s it for the
        reminiscing for now. Just keep in mind, with the new
        season of shows about to start, the constant spattering
        of new music in stores and on the radio, and new movies
        in theaters every week, they all got their start
        somewhere. They are called classics. They have been with
        us throughout the years, and we should not forget them.</strong></font></p>
