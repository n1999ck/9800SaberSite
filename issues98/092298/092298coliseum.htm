        seat between 11,500 - 15,000 people could become a new
        home for the Columbus College Cougar basketball team.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;A coliseum would help us in
        recruiting,&#148; said athletic director and head
        basketball coach Herbert Greene. &#147;It would attract
        good clubs and attract more people.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The Cougars are playing Auburn
        this year, talking to Georgia Tech, and have tentatively
        scheduled games with the University of Florida and
        Florida State, said Greene.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;One of our biggest
        problems is the size of our gym,&#148; said Greene.
        &#147;We could attract collegiate teams on a repeat basis
        if we have the facilities.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>A subcommittee has been formed
        to review marketing and financial data compiled by
        consultant Burt Cohen. The subcommittee will make a
        recommendation on November 15.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Six sizes are being considered,
        ranging from 10,000 to 15,000 seats.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;Columbus College has been
        successful in recruiting athletes because people who come
        here like Columbus,&#148; said Greene. &#147;A new
        coliseum would be a definite plus.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>No definite site has been
        considered, but the committee is looking at land along
        I-185 in the vicinity of Columbus College and the
        downtown area.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;A location close to the
        campus would be advantageous for the College,&#148; said
        Greene. &#147;Anywhere you build it, we want to make use
        of it.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;I would like to sit on
        the sidelines and coach a Columbus College team in front
        of a capacity crowd and have people feel that the team is
        their team,&#148; said Greene. &#147;My dream is to have
        athletic teams on the floor, in the field, that everyone
        in Columbus wants to be associated with.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;It can be done.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><em><strong>Editor's Note: This dream
        will be realized in October 1998 when ground is broken
        for our new Physical Education Complex.</strong></em></font></p>
