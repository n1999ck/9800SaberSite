        <td><font size="4"><strong>Have you ever considered
        joining a campus organization? Lisa Rios did and now she
        gets paid for her work on the Student Programming
        Council. She will also gain valuable experience to put on
        her resume when she graduates in 1999. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Lisa chose to join the SPC after hearing
        about it in a College 105 class. The Student Programming
        Council is made up of students who work hard to provide
        other students with more to do on campus than just attend
        classes.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The SPC is made up of four
        committees which specialize in bringing different types
        of social, cultural, educational and entertaining
        activities to the campus. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Lisa chairs the Public
        Relations Committee, which is responsible for promoting
        the organization and recruiting new members. She is
        majoring in Public Relations and has been able to put the
        techniques she learned in the classroom to work. After
        being with the SPC for only a month, Lisa was promoted to
        Chairperson. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Others in the SPC recognized
        her leadership abilities and suggested she interview for
        the position after the last person resigned. Lisa has
        found the experience to be rewarding and is assured her
        role in the organization is preparing her for a similar
        job after she graduates. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Although she is only required
        to work 5 hours a week, Lisa has been putting in a few
        more hours lately because the SPC is short on members. To
        correct this problem, Lisa has been working on a
        membership drive. The goal is to double the SPC&#146;s
        membership and re-define the organization&#146;s image on
        campus. In a recent survey of students, 67% said they had
        never heard of the SPC. However, 47% expressed an
        interest in learning more about the group.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Lisa believes doubling
        membership is an attainable goal if she could just get
        the word out about how the SPC benefits students. Lisa
        says, &#147;Since joining the organization two quarters
        ago, I have had lots of opportunities to meet many
        different people, travel and have fun.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Lisa also stresses the fact
        that the SPC does not ask a lot of its members. Each
        committee meets once a week for about 30 minutes and
        before each event. During the events, members are
        encouraged to participate and have fun. There are no dues
        to be paid because the SPC is supported through Student
        Activities Fees. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Recently, Lisa attended a
        convention in Indiana sponsored by the National
        Association for Campus Activities. There she was able to
        meet new musical acts and hire them to come to CSU. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>In the past, the SPC has
        brought local acts like Cornbread, Beehive and the John
        Scott Evans Band to perform on campus. Past guest
        speakers have included Alex Hailey and Maya Angelou. The
        SPC also sponsors educational campaigns such as Alcohol
        Awareness Week and Black History Month. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Future events include a Monte
        Carlo Casino Night and more musical acts. Lisa and her
        committee will also be introducing a mascot to help build
        an identity for the SPC.</strong></font></p>
