        do You Say?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>What are you supposed to say in
        certain situations? What do you call the &#147;Native
        Americans&#148; at the &#147;Indian&#148; Cultural
        Festival? What do you call African Americans who refer to
        themselves as something other than what they expect you
        to call them? </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Why do we all bust our
        collective butts to be politically correct when it turns
        out to be a big joke? Here&#146;s a good one: Black
        English, or ebonics. You know what I hear some blacks say
        about that? They say, &#147;What are you talking about?
        Where I&#146;m from, that means uneducated
        English&#146;.&#148; Personally, I don&#146;t care if
        you&#146;re the most politically pampered minority in the
        world, incorrect English is just that, incorrect. I use
        incorrect English, but I&#146;m not gonna&#146; try to
        start a massive new movement to legitimize my linguistic
        laziness. How about this: Steve-phonics. So you want to
        speak differently? Go ahead. You&#146;re even free to
        teach your kids to speak a different way, but English is
        still the accepted unifying language for the USA. No, not
        everyone likes that. But you know what? Change that if
        you like. Until you do, those who don&#146;t know the
        basic rules of English will probably suffer when it comes
        to job interview time. Just a reality check, but ask
        employers of any race who worked hard in school if they
        are likely to be impressed by you if you sound
        uneducated.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Okay, who is in charge of
        inventing those so-called politically correct terms like
        Native American? The Native Americans like to call
        themselves Indians. Maybe not all of them, but just who
        exactly is actually offended by being called Indian? Oh
        yeah? Too bad. As long as you live on Indian Reservations
        and have Indian Cultural Festivals, I&#146;m going to
        refer to you as Indians. If you come to me personally and
        say you are offended, then I might make the exception out
        of courtesy. But if you are a non-Indian and calling
        yourself offended on behalf of the Native Americans, I
        may tell you where to lodge your pretensions. That&#146;s
        it for that pow-wow.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Here&#146;s a good one, one of
        my favorites. Let&#146;s get rid of the rebel flag
        because it was flown during some rough times, even though
        there is documentation showing that it originated for
        reasons other than racist. But let&#146;s keep the good
        old U.S. of A stars and stripes which were flown during
        such high points as the near decimation of some great
        Indian Nation populations and the theft of their land.
        Can you think of some other bad things that Uncle Sam
        did? I can. Do you know how many times you would have to
        change flags because they got soiled? Show me the perfect
        nation or state that has an unblemished flag, and
        I&#146;ll show you some damn fine propaganda. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Here&#146;s one more. Teachers
        with a PhD who raise a fuss because you call them doctor
        instead of professor, even though they realize that you
        didn&#146;t know better. &#147;I worked hard to make this
        position and I expect to be addressed as professor.
        Ignorance is no excuse. When you get out there in the
        real world you may not get a second chance to get the
        proper honorific right&#148; You know what I say?
        &#147;What have you done for me lately?&#148; I pay part
        of your salary and you get the better parking spot. So
        excuse me if I didn&#146;t hear about your tenure (I must
        have missed that edition of Nightly News). And as for the
        real world, let&#146;s not mention how many Professors
        need their hands held when it comes to technical skills
        like, &#147;How do you turn this thing on?&#148; Hello,
        you&#146;re in the real world the moment you are brought
        in to it. Whether you are dependent upon your parents or
        the technical engineers, this is it. You are never really
        on your own.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Okay, if I didn&#146;t answer
        the question &#147;What do you say?&#148; let me put it
        to you like this; use your good judgement. But then, you
        do that already anyway. Right? But try not to be so
        bogged down by so many political agendas which have
        nearly nothing to do with protecting the minorities which
        they claim to. </strong></font></p>
