        <td><font size="4"><strong>Columbus State University
        (CSU) students have an opportunity to study abroad in
        France this summer.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Students
        participating in the program will spend four weeks
        attending classes with other students from around the
        world in Dijon, France. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The program will take place at
        the Center for French Studies, part of the University of
        Bourgogne in Dijon. Dijon is the capital of the Burgundy
        region, which is know for its medieval history. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>2,000 students from about 60
        countries participate in the program each year.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Students will live in
        university residence halls or single occupancy rooms,
        unless they request other housing arrangements. Two meals
        a day are included in the program price, but cooking
        facilities are available on each floor for students who
        prefer to cook their own meals. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The total cost for the program
        is $3,700, which includes CSU tuition, accommodations,
        two meals a day, round-trip airfare from Atlanta to
        Paris, and in-country travel to and from the host
        institution. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The cost does not include
        travel to Atlanta, passport and related expenses.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Typically, students should plan
        to have about $600 to $750 extra money. There may be
        entrance fees to various sites and students should plan
        to spend extra money on entertainment. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Students also have the
        opportunity to travel outside of Dijon at their own
        expense.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Full time or part time students
        are eligible to participate, but space is limited.
        Availability is on a first-come first-serve basis. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Aside from opportunities for
        students, the Dijon program offers a refresher course for
        teachers of French. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Those interested in the program
        should contact Jacqueline Konan, Associate Professor,
        Department of Language and Literature at 568-2054. Konan
        can also be reached by fax at 568-2123. </strong></font></p>
