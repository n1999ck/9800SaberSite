        Barbara J. Hunt is an English professor at CSU&#146;s
        Department of Language and Literature. She received her
        BA in English from Case Western Reserve University, her
        MA in Creative Writing from Indiana University and her
        Ph.D. in English from Peabody College of Vanderbilt
        University.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Other
        than teaching basic and advanced English and Literature
        courses, Dr. Hunt is also involved with several
        committees on campus. She is part of the Honors Program
        and the Advising Committee, which is producing a handbook
        for advisors. She is also in charge of the Semester
        Conversion Task Force.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dr. Hunt has recently received
        the title of Assistant Dean of the New University
        College. She explained that CSU is one of two Georgia
        Universities that is undergoing an experimental program
        in which we will offer a two-year university within a
        four-year university starting next fall. The two-year
        university will be a type of junior college offered
        because there are none in our area. Dr. Hunt also
        explained that without this program, about 40% of the
        applicants would not be able to attend CSU due to poor
        high school transcripts or test scores. Even though she
        now has this administrative position, she will still be
        teaching full-time.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>In her private time, Dr. Hunt
        enjoys &#147;surfing the net&#148;. She also likes to go
        hiking and bicycling with her 14-year-old son.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>When asked about her hopes for
        CSU, Hunt replied,&#148;I hope we can do more faculty and
        student exchanges within our country and abroad. With the
        amount summer study abroad programs growing each year at
        CSU, it seems her dream is already coming true.</strong></font></p>
