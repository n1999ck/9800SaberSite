        <td><font size="4"><strong>February 1998 </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>As the time approaches for spring and
        summer breaks, many college students are getting ready
        for that long planned trip abroad. Most will have a safe
        and enjoyable adventure, but for some, the trip will
        become a nightmare. The best way to ensure that you have
        a reasonably safe trip is to be well informed before you
        leave.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The U.S. State Department
        provides travel safety information to assist you in
        planning your trip abroad. The State Department issues
        Consular Information Sheets, Travel Warnings, Public
        Announcements, and country or regional publications.
        There is a Consular Information Sheet for every country
        in the world with information on passport and visa
        requirements, the risk of crime, the condition of medical
        care, areas of unrest, the location of the nearest U.S.
        embassy or consulate, and other items. Travel Warnings
        are issued when the State Department decides, based on
        all relevant information, to recommend that Americans
        avoid travel to all or part of a country. Public
        Announcements are issued to dessiminate information
        quickly terrorist threats and other relatively short-term
        and/or trans-national conditions posing significant risks
        or disruptions to Americans. Occurrences such as bomb
        threats to airlines, weapons shipments and violence by
        terrorists, coups or anniversary dates of terrorist
        events have resulted in such Announcements.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>On occasion, Americans
        encounter difficulties abroad because they were not
        familiar with local laws, customs, or conditions. More
        than 2,500 American citizens are arrested abroad every
        year &#151; many of them for violating local laws
        regarding the use of alcohol in public and the behavior
        associated with it.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Many young people visit popular
        resort areas and overindulge in alcohol, assuming that
        because the atmosphere appears &#147;more laid-back than
        in the States,&#148; such conduct is overlooked by local
        authorities. A number of students also assume that they
        are immune from prosecution in foreign lands because they
        are American citizens. The truth is that Americans are
        subject to the laws of the country in which they are
        traveling. Those who violate foreign laws may face severe
        penalties, including fines and imprisonment. In the past,
        American college students have been arrested for being
        intoxicated in public areas and for drunk driving, as
        well as for various other violations.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Once you leave United States
        soil, U.S. laws and constitutional rights no longer
        apply. U.S. consular officers can visit jailed Americans
        to see that they are being fairly and humanely treated,
        but cannot get them out of jail or intervene in a foreign
        country&#146;s legal system on their behalf.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Remember: getting too relaxed
        while in another country can do more than ruin your
        vacation; it can land you in a foreign jail. To have a
        safe trip, become familiar with the basic laws and
        customs of the country you plan to visit before you
        travel. The State Department encourages you to check the
        Consular Affairs&#146; home page on the internet:
        http://travel. state.gov for the latest travel safety
        information.</strong></font></p>
