        <td><font size="4"><strong>Thursday the campus was
        crawling with men and women in black suits, wearing
        sunglasses and carrying briefcases. As they passed,
        people on campus turned and wondered who they were and
        what was going on. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Most
        everyone knows by now that the visitors where here in
        prelude to a visit from Vice President Al Gore. Gore did
        not arrive until Monday, but many of his crew arrived
        early and kept things busy on campus throughout the
        weekend.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>It was interesting to watch
        what all goes on behind the scenes before an event such
        as this. Something about seeing the little tricks of the
        trade, the preparation, kept me more entertained than the
        speech itself. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>There were little problems,
        such as the signs behind the Vice President in the gym.
        Gore&#146;s people wanted the CSU Cougar signs on the
        wall to be removed before the speech. Diligent workers
        began removing the signs when it was noticed that the
        paint behind the signs were a strikingly different color
        than the rest of the wall. It was decided the signs would
        stay. I wonder if the painter was fired.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I learned a lot from his visit,
        but not about ICAPP. For instance, the seal displayed on
        the podium he stood behind is removable. It was
        originally a CSU emblem, then some man in a dark suit
        came by, snatched it off and replaced it with the Vice
        President&#146;s very own, portable seal. I always
        thought he brought his own podium, I guess. Maybe I never
        really thought about it at all. It was just a small piece
        of embossed wood or plastic. The thought of this being
        carried around in the trunk of a car kind of takes the
        mystic out of the whole thing.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong><img src="030998water.jpg" align="right" hspace="0" width="252" height="320"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>Also, while leafing through some
        photographs of the event, I noticed a couple of them
        caught the table just next to Gore&#146;s feet. The table
        was hidden from the view of the audience by a cloth
        divider. On the table sat several containers of bottled
        water, some of them tipped over. Well, Vice Presidents
        and important political leaders get thirsty too. Just one
        more little secret.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I was also amused by the music
        played just before the speech. First there was the theme
        to Rocky, then the Vice President of the United States
        made his way to the podium while the song &#147;ABC&#148;
        by the Jackson Five played.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Although much of the behind the
        scenes sort of things I noticed were strictly comical,
        there were some incidents that were a little sobering. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I arrived early to cover the
        event and my stomach was a little queasy from the
        excitement. I headed downstairs to the cafeteria to get
        breakfast. When I stepped in the seating area many of the
        dark suited men were sitting there. They were accompanied
        by several very beautiful, man eating (or woman eating as
        the case may be) German Shepards. The dogs tilted their
        heads and eerily studied me as I crossed the floor. Their
        human companions did not seem any friendlier. I decided
        to eat upstairs.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>On the whole the strangers
        wandering campus were friendly and only occasionally
        annoyed with the locals. Some students near the gym asked
        one Secret Service man if they could pet his dog. The
        Service man sneered, &#147;I wouldn&#146;t&#148;. The
        students didn&#146;t. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>While there were some reports
        of the Secret Service men joking with students and
        administrators, they were all business when Gore showed
        up. Smiles faded to stern frowns and the spotlight was
        cast on only the Vice President. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I actually heard one of his
        people say &#147;What&#146;s your 1/20&#148; into a mini
        microphone, which is something I thought only happened in
        movies. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The event was very high energy
        and it was exhausting covering it. But just seeing what
        went into it was enough to make it worth.</strong></font></p>
