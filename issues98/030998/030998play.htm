        Based on the play by Jean Poiret, La Cage Aux Folles is a
        riveting musical concerning the trials and triumphs of
        living an alternative lifestyle and a father&#146;s
        undying love.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong><img src="030998Cagelles.jpg" align="right" hspace="0" width="288" height="200"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>La
        Cage Aux Folles was originally written as a play and was
        later created as an original French film. Then came the
        Broadway musical and the more popular version, the movie,
        The Birdcage, starring Robin Williams as Georges and
        Nathan Lane as Albin.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Georges and Albin are a happily
        &#147;married&#148; couple of twenty years. They have a
        lovely son, Jean-Michel, who has just announced his
        engagement to Anne Dindon. Anne happens to be the
        daughter of a very important stiff necked political
        figure who specializes in morality. The catch is Georges
        and Albin are two homosexual males. The only chance of
        gaining Mr. Dindons approval of his daughters marriage to
        Jean-Michel is to pass this family off as an upstanding
        moral unit of the community.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The strengths and fragilities
        of love are portrayed in a somewhat poetic fashion, which
        encompasses the theme of this musical: the unconditional
        love of a father, the durable love of a lifelong couple,
        and the intoxicating effects of young love. All of this
        along with the musical direction and comedic consistency
        is what makes this into one of the biggest hit musicals
        of its decade.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>It was definitely a big hit for
        the CSU theater department. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dr. Hazel Hall, Department Head
        and Professor of Theater Arts and director of La Cage Aux
        Folles, felt the play was a success. &#147;We had
        standing ovations every night,&#148; Hall says.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Hall says the experience seemed
        to be positive for everyone involved. &#147;I heard no
        negative comments from anyone.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>There were only a few minor
        problems for the cast. At one performance an actors shoe
        broke and in one show there was microphone malfunction,
        which had to be quickly corrected. Other than those and a
        few other very small incidents the show ran smoothly,
        according to Hall. &#147;I knew the play would work. A
        lot of hard work went into it and I knew it was a solid
        play.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Hall says she did have some
        concern about the play before it went into production
        because of the subject matter. However, Hall says that
        she has not heard of any negative feedback and that some
        people even thanked her for broaching the subject.
        &#147;One woman told me she was going to tell her pastor
        to see the show. I&#146;m glad we did it.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>There was no notable protest of
        the Williams&#146; film, &#147;The Birdcage&#148; and
        Hall says that was taken into consideration before the
        play was chosen. She says that if there had been
        protesters in the community, the play would not have been
        chosen.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;I really enjoyed it.
        Despite the play&#146;s &#145;interesting&#146; subject
        matter, I feel that the Theater Department did a great
        job of pulling off the show with a great deal of
        class,&#148; One CSU student says. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The surprising twist of the
        Grand Finale completes the illusion which creates a
        paradox that is the basis of the entire show.</strong></font></p>
