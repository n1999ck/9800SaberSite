        <td><font size="4"><strong>Most of us have heard the term
        ROTC and know has something to do with the military and
        trying to be &#147;all that you can be&#148;. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>ROTC stands for Reserve Officer Training
        Course and is offered here at CSU. It is a four year
        program geared to help develop the future officer
        leadership of the US Army. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong><img src="022398rotc.jpg" align="right" hspace="0" width="303" height="160"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>A student is given classroom instruction
        on leadership techniques with strong emphasis placed on
        practical application in a field setting. When the
        student successfully completes the military science
        curriculum and various other requirements established by
        the Department of the Army, he or she will be
        commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant and may serve in the
        active army or the reserves and national guard. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Increasing awareness about the
        importance of self-discipline, physical fitness and good
        leadership skills, the program is open to undergraduate
        and graduate students interested in personal growth and
        development. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The program is split into two
        major phases: The basic course and the advanced course.
        Each course lasts over a period of two years. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>If a student enrolls at his or
        her own expense or with other financial aid without
        taking advantage of a military scholarship, they can
        participate in the program without signing a contract
        obligating themselves to ever become part of the
        military. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>A student could become part of
        the reserves or national guard and draw a paycheck from
        the military. The time spent in the reserves or military
        guard will then, should the student later decide to
        become active army, be credited to their &#147;years of
        service&#148;. He or she would start out with a higher
        salary than the average Lieutenant, just joining the
        military, without any previous reserve or national guard
        experience. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>If a student signs up on a
        military scholarship, tuition and books will be paid for,
        however, you will obligate yourself to the Army for a
        minimum of eight years after you have completed your
        degree. These eight years can either be spent in the
        active military (2 - 4 years minimum) or the reserves or
        National Guard (8 years minimum).</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>A sophomore is required to
        attend military classes one hour per week. A freshman
        would take two hours per week. PT (physical training) on
        Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 6:00 a.m. until
        7:00 a.m. is still optional at this point. Military
        activities also include two 3-day field exercises per
        year. Physical training tests are given at the beginning
        and the end of the quarter/semester to determine physical
        fitness of the students as well as to determine the
        students&#146; progress.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Courses such as &#147;Intro to
        The Army Today&#148;, &#147;Basic Military Skills&#148;
        and &#147;Map Reading/Navigation&#148; Courses are part
        of the basic course curriculum. Non-scholarship
        participants can experience military lifestyles first
        hand to see if they would like to consider a military
        career. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Military activities remain the
        same over the last two years, however, a junior or senior
        will take three hours of military classes per week and PT
        will no longer be optional. At the beginning of the
        advanced course, the student who is not on a military
        scholarship will be officially sworn in and will sign a
        contract with the US Army that, upon completion of the
        program, he/she will join the military and serve as a
        commissioned officer for a minimum of eight years. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>At the end of the third year
        the student will attend a five week camp at Ft. Louis,
        Washington to determine their leadership potential. Aside
        from this camp the student will take advanced classes on
        the subject of military leadership, management, military
        ethics, professionalism and the military justice system. <br>
        Interested students can contact Captain Sheila Denham,
        ROTC, Stanley Hall basement at 568-2449 or send her an
        e-mail here on campus. </strong></font></p>
