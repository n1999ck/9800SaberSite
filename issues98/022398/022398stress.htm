        <td><font size="4"><strong>Stress n. ...a state in which
        a strong demand is made on the nervous system......(per
        Webster). </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>There
        are many causes of stress for college students these
        days. There are the obvious ones, lack of time ,
        workload, lack of money, professor demands and
        motivation. Time is a big factor. Taking a full load is
        exactly as it sounds; a full load.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>A large number of students at
        Columbus State are attending full time and not only does
        the class time consume a large portion of students&#146;
        days, but finding time to study seems to be a problem for
        a number of students as well. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Shannon Morey, a communications
        major at CSU says that she has to consider her son when
        scheduling classes. She says that she has to take night
        classes often because her husband works during the day.
        The stressful aspect of this situation is that she does
        not get to spend the quality time in the evenings with
        her son that she would like.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Some students claim that the
        workload can place a great deal of stress on them.
        Shawanda Watkins is taking 23 hours this quarter and
        finding time and motivation to study seems difficult at
        times. Shawanda also says that her mother attends
        Columbus State and the two of them are quite competitive
        with their grades.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Money seems to be a very common
        stress factor for almost any college student, regardless
        of the workload. Any student receiving loans that must be
        paid back will have that lurking over their head until
        well after graduation. This realization places added
        pressure on top of the usual stresses of being a college
        student. Also, a large number of students are unable to
        work during college and often do not have the money it
        takes just to survive on a day to day basis.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>There are other not so obvious
        factors that some may not consider when dealing with
        students. Some students feel that professors, do not seem
        to consider that students have other classes. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Also, the CSU student body is
        quite unique compared to other universities in our
        region. Many of the students here are local and the
        average age is 25-35. It is very hard to balance full
        time jobs, bills, spouses and children and obtain a
        college degree at the same time.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Buddy Bergy states that he has
        been out of high school for over ten years and he is
        having to &#147;relearn&#148; how to be a student. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Most students handle the stress
        of college life quite well. But for those students who
        cannot seem to deal, never fear. There is help. The
        Counseling Center, located in 146 Davidson Student
        Center, offers many services to the students at CSU. They
        provide a professional and confidential service to
        students.</strong></font></p>
