    although very funny, playing a more toned down serious part. The story is set in the
    mid-eighties and if the clothes and hair styles aren&#146;t funny enough, <img src="022398wedding.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="288" height="187">Sandler
    makes a living as a wedding singer living in his sister&#146;s basement. </strong></font><p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>On the day Sandler&#146;s character Robbie Hart is to
    be married he is left at the alter which in turns effects his motivation to perform at
    weddings. Along the way Robbie meets Julie (Drew Barrymore) and they fast become friends.
    Julie consoles Robbie and asks if he would mind helping out for her wedding, which is
    slated to take place in three months. Her fiancée is a womanizing Miami Vice, Don
    Johnson-esque, jerk of a fiancée. As the story progresses Drew finds that she is in love
    with Robbie, and with the help of Billy Idol and Ann Landers Robbie is able to intervene
    on Julie&#146;s Vegas weekend wedding to save the day and live happily ever after with the
    girl of his dreams. ***</strong></font></td>
