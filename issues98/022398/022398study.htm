        <td><font size="4"><strong>Wednesday, February 4, 1998</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Boston - A study by Harvard School of
        Public Health researchers reports that college students
        who engage in binge drinking, have multiple sexual
        partners or use marijuana were two to six times more
        likely to smoke than students who do not engage in these
        risky behaviors. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The link between smoking and
        drinking, reported in this month&#146;s issue of The
        American Journal of Public Health, suggests that if
        colleges and universities can establish policies and
        programs to reduce drinking or smoking, other high risk
        behaviors can be curtailed. This is the largest
        population-based study of its kind to examine these
        health-related behaviors among students. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Investigators analyzed data
        from the Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol
        Study, a survey of 140 college campuses and over 17,000
        students concerning lifestyle, academic performance and
        drug use including alcohol and smoking. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Nearly half the students
        surveyed had a history of smoking: 22% were current
        smokers and 25% had smoked at one time. Previous findings
        from the same survey of students shows that freshman
        students typically readily engage in binge drinking at
        colleges where binge drinking is prevalent.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;As college bound
        students, especially freshmen, prepare to arrive college
        campuses next fall, parents and students need to be alert
        to the complexity of drug use on campus,&#148; comments
        Karen M. Emmons, PhD, first author on the study and
        associate professor of health and social behavior at the
        Harvard School of Public Health and a researcher at the
        Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. &#147;Our study also finds
        that students who are uninterested in campus activities
        or are dissatisfied with their educational program are
        more likely to smoke. Policies and interventions by
        college administration, involving resident advisors, for
        example, that seek to engage students in college
        activities can address the problems that are connected to
        the initiation of risky behaviors such as smoking and
        drinking.&#148;</strong></font></p>
