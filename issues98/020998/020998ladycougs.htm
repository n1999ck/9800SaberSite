        <td><font size="4">With victories over two of the top
        teams in the Peach Belt Conference, the Columbus State
        Lady Cougars remained unbeaten in conference play and
        moved up to number two in the South-Atlantic Region poll.
        The most impressive of the victories was a stunning
        victory over Francis Marion who, at 18-1 and 10-0 in the
        conference, was ranked at number 16 in the national polls
        and was the front runner in the Peach Belt&#146;s North
        Division. The Lady Cougars also racked up victories at
        USC-Aiken and then defeated the Georgia College &amp; St.
        University Lady Bobcats, who were the second place team
        behind Columbus in the PBAC South Division.</font><p><font size="4">The Lady Cougars travelled to South Carolina to
        play two games in as many days, the first time this was
        attempted this season for CSU. The first stop was
        Florence, S.C. and the home of the nationally ranked
        Patriots from Francis Marion. The Lady Cougars took an
        early lead and held off a fierce comeback to down the
        Patriots 72-60. When Francis Marion pulled within one
        point late in the first half, sophomore guard Christina
        Iler took charge and went on a 6-0 run of her own. Iler
        finished with 12 points, all in the first half. After
        expanding their lead to as many as 19 in the second half,
        the Lady Cougars soon found themselves battling to stay
        in the lead. The Patriots went on a crucial 20-5 run but
        could get no closer than four points as the Lady Cougars
        pulled away in the games closing minutes. Senior Que
        Gilliam led the Lady Cougars with 18 points and pulled
        down a career high 19 rebounds.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The very next day Columbus took on the
        Lady Pacers from USC-Aiken. After being down for the
        majority of the first half, the Lady Cougars came
        storming back and eventually defeated Aiken by 14 points,
        79-65. Robyn Davis led the Lady Cougars to victory with
        15 points. Tocshia Campfield added 14. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">After their success on the road, the
        Lady Cougars returned home to face off with the second
        place Lady Bobcats from Georgia College &amp; St.
        University. Columbus appeared to be on the way to another
        one of their huge blowouts as an eight point halftime
        lead grew into a seemingly impossible wall of 20 in the
        second half. The 20 point lead soon disappeared and the
        Lady Bobcats were breathing down Columbus&#146; neck. The
        Lady Cougars scored only two points in the games final
        4:00 minutes allowing Georgia College to pull within six
        points. Fortunately for CSU the clock ran out on the Lady
        Bobcats and six was as close as they could get. Columbus
        survived a 33-point game from Georgia College forward
        Tamarra Brown and squeaked past the Lady Bobcats 96-89.
        Columbus was led by Gilliam and Campfield who both scored
        18 points. The victory over Georgia College ran the Lady
        Cougars record to 18-4 and 12-0 in the conference. The
        win also lowered the Lady Cougar&#146;s magic number to
        four for a conference championship. </font></p>
