        <td><font size="4">The Columbus State men&#146;s
        basketball team recently recorded two key victories and a
        disappointing loss but still remain in the lead in the
        Peach Belt conference.</font><p><font size="4">The
        Cougars first took on the Francis Marion Patriots in
        Florence, South Carolina. The Patriots entered the game
        as the first place team in the Peach Belt Conference
        North Division with a 14-7 record, 10-2 in the
        conference. Columbus jumped out to an early lead by
        holding the Patriots scoreless for close to seven
        minutes. By halftime the Cougar lead was sixteen. In the
        second half Francis Marion made a charge but their effort
        was foiled by an unlikely source. Quincey Richardson, who
        most defenses forget about, took charge and helped spread
        the Cougar lead by converting on three consecutive
        three-point plays. The Patriots continued to stay close
        but could get no closer than three points. Richardson
        scored a career high 16 points and nine rebounds. Senior
        Larry Coates continued his stellar season with a
        game-high 23 points.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">After disposing of Francis Marion, the
        Cougars travelled to Aiken, South Carolina to face the
        USC-Aiken Pacers. Columbus took a two point lead on their
        very first possession of the game but that was the last
        time the scoreboard would show the Cougars in the lead.
        The Pacers stretched their lead to as many as 18 points
        in the second half. The Cougars could never get on track
        and fell 95-77. The fatal blow dealt by the Pacers was a
        combined 67 points and 33 rebounds by their top three
        players. Calvin Hill and Quinton Peterson led the Cougars
        with 17 points.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Clinging to an ever narrowing lead in
        the Peach Belt Conference, Columbus entered their next
        game against the Georgia College Bobcats looking for a
        confidence boosting victory and the chance to tighten up
        their conference lead. Behind the pinpoint shooting of
        Hill and Peterson, the Cougars got just what they wanted.
        Together, Hill and Peterson connected on 20-27 field goal
        attempts. For Hill and Peterson it was a story of two
        halves. Hill scored 20 of his game-high 31 points in the
        first half and Peterson followed that by collecting 21 of
        his 25 points in the second half. The Bobcats stayed
        close throughout the game and even held a slim lead at
        one point. The Cougars then went on a 12-0 run in the
        second half to pull far enough ahead to claim a 93-83
        victory in front of 1,125 at Woodruff Gym.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The victory over Georgia College upped
        the Cougar&#146;s record to 20-5 and 9-3 in the Peach
        Belt Conference. Columbus also held onto their slim one
        game conference lead over second place Kennesaw State.</font></p>
