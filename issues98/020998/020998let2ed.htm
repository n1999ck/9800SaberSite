        <td><font size="4">While little attention is paid to the
        plight of adjunct instructors, your university student
        newspaper is to be commended for even broaching the
        subject. That said, the article only skimmed the surface.
        Rather than talking to a full-time (and most likely
        tenured) professor who defends the proliferating practice
        of hiring part-time adjunct instructors, a few comments
        from adjuncts at your university (anonymous, of course to
        protect them from possible retaliation for speaking the
        truth) would have added balance to the article. </font><p><font size="4">Let me say that I have been an adjunct professor
        at five different colleges, though not at CSU. However, I
        do know people who have adjuncted at CSU. I will share
        with you a bit of that netherworld called
        &#147;adjuncting.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">For those who adjunct as supplemental
        income or even the fun of it in addition to their
        &#147;real&#148; (usually full-time work or as
        post-retirement work) &#151; there are few if any
        problems. And your article is accurate in stating that
        little is expected of these adjuncts in terms of
        publishing or service (committee work).</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">However, many adjuncts are
        underemployed and wish to be full-time in higher
        education. For the underemployed, being an adjunct is the
        nightmarish proverbial Catch-22. We are expected to
        deliver the same quality of courses with few or in some
        cases, NO basic resources: office space, student
        assistants, secretarial support, research funds, funds to
        travel to conferences, etc. And yet, adjuncts must have
        high teaching evaluations and some publishing or
        we&#146;ll never be full-time in the academy. I&#146;ve
        spent every penny earned some quarters just funding my
        own research and travel to stay viable in the academy in
        hopes of obtaining full-time work. And as an adjunct, I
        have taken time to attend faculty and student
        presentations, offered to do some unofficial committee
        work, and advising, so the service aspect is also
        covered.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Further and most troubling, adjuncts
        have no real voice. At best, adjuncts are usually treated
        with indifference by full-time faculty and
        administrators. At worst, adjuncts have no say in
        university or departmental rulings that affect our very
        lives.<br>
        Even the research done by adjuncts must not be too
        controversial because we are not as protected in our
        pursuit of academic freedom as full-time faculty are.
        Adjuncts are ostensibly covered by the 1940 declaration
        of academic freedom by the American Association of
        University Professors (AAUP) which most universities
        purport to follow. In reality, adjuncts are not fully
        covered by this declaration. No organization would be
        foolish enough to state the real reason for a non-renewal
        of a contract for a controversial adjunct; the
        organization would simply state that the services of a
        particular adjunct were no longer needed or some other
        pretext for what is really a dismissal.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Thus, an adjunct is really a nobody.
        It&#146;s very hard for anyone to be constantly reminded
        that they have no status, that they&#146;re no one
        important &#151; but though a nobody, had better do a
        good job and conform or they&#146;ll stay a nobody.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Adjuncts face double standards.
        Everyone has a bad day at work once in awhile for
        personal or professional reasons, but an adjunct cannot
        without some potentially serious consequences. More often
        than not, we must be &#147;collegial&#148; (academic code
        talk for behaving like others want you to behave) at all
        times and avoid even the slightest hint of disagreement
        that might lead to a confrontation with arrogant
        administrators, indifferent departmental faculty, or
        students who question any aspect of our course. We have
        to be everything for everybody &#151; all the while with
        a smile on our faces (most often accompanied by the
        immense pain in our brains for not being able to speak
        our minds or act freely).</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">What a vicious cycle! What&#146;s most
        depressing is that constant feeling of being on the
        outside &#151; looking in (and sometimes looking in on a
        group of academics of questionable quality while our own
        energy goes down the drain in just dealing with the
        constant marginalization). An adjunct has no real voice;
        we can only watch (and hope).</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">English Professor Jim Owen commented
        that restricted course sizes created a need for adjuncts.
        If a department has more than 6 classes per quarter that
        are consistently being filled by adjuncts, then there is
        not &#147;a need to employ more part-time faculty&#148;
        as asserted by Professor Owens; there is in fact, a
        faculty shortage!</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Then to exacerbate the situation
        further, when positions do come open, universities around
        the country are increasingly filling formerly full-time,
        tenure-track positions with career-track positions
        (multi-year contracts with no tenure) or dividing the
        position up among multiple adjuncts. It saves a great
        deal of money for the department and the student;
        however, not everything rests with the price tag.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">As noted in your article, one cost is
        that students have difficulty in reaching adjunct
        professors during the course (and the adjuncts often take
        a hit on their course evaluations on
        &#147;availability&#148; when actually the University has
        not provided the resources for the professor to be
        available). Further, students who may have had an adjunct
        for a course or courses are often left with no way to
        reach them after the course for job references or letters
        of recommendation to graduate/professional school.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">In short: Students lose role models.
        Other faculty lose potential colleagues. Universities
        lose loyalty.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">But the biggest loser by far is the
        adjunct who often works multiple part-time jobs just to
        scrape together an existence and a career. Anyone who has
        worked multiple part-time jobs knows that a few part-time
        jobs quickly equal more than a single full-time job (with
        the multiple trips and multiple administrations to deal
        with). Then there&#146;s the low monetary pay with no
        insurance, medical, or retirement benefits.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">In fact, with adjuncts &#151; even pay
        is not guaranteed. We are asked to block out three months
        of our lives (and,even longer on a semester system) well
        in advance of the quarter start date which prevents us
        from taking other work for the reserved time period.
        Then, if a class doesn&#146;t fill up, we are told &#151;
        often days before the start of the quarter &#151; that
        the class won&#146;t be taught. Thus, adjuncts are often
        left with an open schedule with no other immediate work
        options, no work and thus, no pay &#151; even though time
        my have already been spent in preparing the course.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">You listed the &#147;flexibility in
        departmental scheduling&#148; as an advantage for the use
        of adjuncts. But with this scenario, only the adjunct is
        the one who is required to be &#147;flexible&#148; with
        no guarantee that their flexibility will be rewarded.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Flexibility is also required of an
        adjunct who may teach courses on a &#147;split
        shift&#148; (a combination of morning, afternoon, or
        evening classes with a long break in between). I have
        spent countless hours in the library, attempting to do
        profitable research, reading, or course grading. But that
        schedule is often tiring when there&#146;s no place to
        relax in private in what becomes a 12+ hour day.
        I&#146;ve had to drag all of my materials to the
        restroom, lest they be stolen. I&#146;ve had my
        &#147;office&#148; in my car trunk, working out of it
        like an academic homeless person. I&#146;ve had to return
        student messages on a pay phone from the library lobby
        because the academic offices are locked up after 5 p.m.
        and we are not always given keys. I&#146;ve had to call
        campus security to let me back in a building when.1 left
        something in a classroom after an evening course, because
        I didn&#146;t have building keys. I could go on, but my
        point is that all of these types of events serve to
        remind adjuncts that they have great flexibility and no
        status.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">As for monetary pay, check out what the
        average adjunct is paid at CSU. You&#146;ll be surprised
        and hopefully, dismayed. In many of the Georgia system
        colleges and universities (and not just the main campus),
        some adjuncts are paid $4000 per class (a fairly
        reasonable rate given there are no benefits). However, I
        know of a professor with teaching and career experience
        who taught a course in the business school at CSU for a
        paltry $1200! Most professors teach 8 courses a year. I
        can guarantee you there is not a single faculty person at
        CSU who is working for $9600 per year with no benefits!</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Given that a professor spends an
        average of 3 hours (for some areas of specialization like
        English, it&#146;s even higher) outside of the classroom
        (preparing, grading, etc.) for every hour spent in the
        classroom, that pay rate amounts to about $7.50 per hour.
        Thus many adjuncts would be better off getting over-time
        pay at the local Quick Change! Considering that many
        adjuncts have a doctorate which requires a minimum of
        eight years of college coursework (and I don&#146;t have
        to add up the college fees for you for that amount of
        time), that rate of pay is (to put it nicely) a disgrace.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">University administrations tout how
        &#147;valued&#148; adjuncts are, but in reality little
        has been done to improve the lot of adjuncts in higher
        education in terms of pay, resources, or security.
        Actions do speak louder than words. The few attempts at
        unionization by adjuncts have been net with great and
        vocal opposition (and often retaliation) by university
        administrations. So, it&#146;s not a big shock that there
        are only a few of the thousands of college campuses in
        the nation where part-time faculty are unionized.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Thus, in evaluating and writing about
        any work situation, you need to ask, Who benefits? Who
        loses? And why. In the case of adjuncts, the advantage
        clearly goes to the university institution or adjuncts
        working for supplemental pay or the fun of it. The career
        adjunct who is underemployed has little if any benefit
        except that far off prospect of full-time work.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Greater research into the adjunct
        situation will reveal that adjuncting is the dirty secret
        of higher education and an issue one that many
        administrations-is do not want to address. Many
        academics, who are otherwise politically correct and very
        attuned to multi-culturalism, are guilty of treating
        adjuncts in the same manner that they are harshly
        critical of others in power of treating minority or other
        special groups of people.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The proliferation of part-time adjunct
        instructors cannot be explained away by increased college
        enrollment. The proliferation of part-time adjunct
        instructors can only be explained by the conscious
        decision of university administration to cut costs at the
        expense of the marginalization of a group of highly
        educated workers. In a sense, it remarkably similar to
        the oppression wrought in the Industrial Revolution. Only
        now, the setting has changed from a factory to the
        classroom where the means of production are controlled by
        an elitist administration over a group of workers who
        have no voice, no security, and minimal pay.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">For a candid and realistic look inside
        the life of adjuncts, order the video &#147;Degrees of
        Shame&#148; from Barbara Wolf Video Work (1709 Pomona
        Court Cincinnati, OH 45206 &#151; (513)861-2462). This
        creative work is reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin&#146;s
        films which often edited in reel footage of various
        events to make a specific point, like in his film
        &#147;Modern Times.&#148; Wolf&#146;s film consists of a
        series of interviews with adjuncts set against the 1960
        CBS Documentary &#147;Harvest of Shame,&#148; an Edward
        R. Murrow film which recounted the lives of migrant farm
        workers.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Wolf is not the first to deal with the
        migratory, low status aspect of adjunct work. In fact,
        this was also noted in a 1994 front page story in The
        Wall Street Journal. There was even a term applied
        adjuncters who teach at multiple institutions:
        &#147;Highway Flyers&#148; because of the necessity to
        drive between several colleges and universities just in
        order to patch together a semblance of a career.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The next time your adjunct instructor
        seem a little depressed, fatigued, or apathetic &#151;
        think of the conditions and pay under which they are
        working. That recognition will go a long way.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">So, why do adjuncts do it? I cannot
        answer for all adjuncts, but I do it because I am
        dedicated to the profession of higher education: I love
        knowledge; I love teaching; I love the energy of
        students; and I am very good at it. I have turned down
        positions in &#147;the real world&#148; that paid as much
        as $75,000 in order to attempt to get on full-time in
        higher education. it&#146;s impossible to work full-time
        and remain &#147;flexible&#148; for course scheduling,
        publish to remain viable in the academy, and do some
        level of campus or community service.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">I still have no voice. I am still
        watching, waiting, and hoping . . .</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Sign me,</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">An adjunct extraordinaire</font></p>
