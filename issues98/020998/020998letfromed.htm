        <td><font size="4">The media was created to be a watchdog
        for the American people. To protect them by giving all
        the facts for the public to form an opinion. Today, some
        in the media are trying to save us from the burden of
        thinking by simply telling us their opinion and leaving
        it at that. </font><p><font size="4">The Clinton
        situation has been an interesting one to watch. It is not
        the story that has held my attention, it is how many
        times the news programs forget to say &#147;alleged&#148;.
        It is equally disturbing how many shows have titled there
        segments &#147;Crisis in the White House.&#148; </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">I am just as sick of hearing about our
        president&#146;s alleged sexual relations as you are,
        but, it is a learning experience regarding what is fact
        or fiction in the media. It also proves the point all to
        well that you cannot just read one newspaper or watch one
        television show and say, &#147;Alright, now I know the
        whole truth.&#148; </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">I think we are getting back to the era
        of yellow journalism that was prevalent in the 1890&#146;s.
        This was when newspapers used sensational tactics to sell
        more newspapers. It&#146;s not a new concept to
        sensationalize a story, but one would hope it would be an
        outdated concept by now. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">This has to happen every decade or so
        where an alleged &#147;scandal&#148; breaks out and the
        story is more important than the facts and sources. The
        past couple of weeks, the media has been chasing each
        others leads and following each others sources. This is
        known as &#147;piggybacking&#148; in journalism. All the
        networks are running around in a frenzy giving opinions
        when they should just be giving the facts. When
        competition to get the story first is so fierce, opinions
        turn into rumors, rumors turn into allegations, and
        allegations turn into facts. The most important issue has
        become to get the story out fast with no concern
        regarding the facts.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">On January 25 it seems that the press
        discovered the error of their ways. On CBS it was
        repeatedly explained to the viewing public to remember,
        these were simply allegations. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">They just don&#146;t seem to get that
        we are tired of it. On &#147;Good Morning America Sunday&#148;
        Sam Donaldson was making the point that the American
        people don&#146;t care, but maybe they should. The
        reporters think we should be interested in this story
        because it is a moral question involving the president. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">To all the reporters who think the
        American people have declining morals I would like to
        pose this possibility. It is not the decay of society
        that you should blame for the disinterest, it is because
        people are more intelligent and democratic than we once
        were. We aren&#146;t going to convict him unless the
        facts convict him. It&#146;s that silly little thought of
        fair trial and innocence until proven guilty. Maybe you&#146;ve
        heard of it. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">On January 31 ABC News said in an
        article &#147;A variety of factors helped Clinton in the
        past week; one may be a public inclination to rally
        around him in the face of media onslaught. Americans now
        divide evenly on whether the news media treated Clinton
        fairly or not; that reflects an 11 point increase in the
        number who say the media have been unfair.&#148; A CNN
        Poll said 72% of the people surveyed believe coverage was
        excessive. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Monday The Dallas Morning News reported
        that a Secret Service agent was ready to testify that he
        had seen President Clinton and Lewinsky in a &#147;compromising
        situation.&#148; This report was quickly retracted but it
        should never have been printed in the first place.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Everything leaked by the independent
        council is taken as fact. The &#147;facts&#148; are not
        confirmed by any other source. The media does not try to
        support these &#147;facts&#148; because they make great
        headlines. Maybe they are too good to be real.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The main issue is not who received the
        fair or unfair treatment in the media. I personally just
        want the same amount of importance placed on the facts as
        the who is first with the story. </font></p>
