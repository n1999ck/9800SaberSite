        in The Wellness Fair coming to CSU beginning February 9.</font><p><font size="4">The fair will begin with a Health Profile in
        Davidson room 222. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The Health Profile consists of blood
        drawing and testing. The blood will be tested for several
        things including cholesterol, uric acid, blood count, and
        triglycerides. The cost of the testing is $20.00 and an
        appointment is necessary.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The following week the main activities
        begin. On February 18 form 10:00 am to 2:00 pm. twenty
        four off campus organizations and 7 on campus
        organizations will be available to talk with students
        about their services in the upper floor of Davidson. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Anna Bellemare, owner of Anna&#146;s
        Therapeutic Massage, will be participating in the fair. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Bellemare says, &#147;It is important
        to make people aware that massage is not just a luxury,
        but a part of better health.&#148; She also believes the
        fair is a good opportunity to educate people and allow
        people to see massage first hand. Last year Anna&#146;s
        offered massages to students, Bellemare says she hopes to
        do the same this year.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Also available will be stress tests,
        anxiety tests, diabetes tests, a heart risk assessment,
        and a body fat consultation. There will exhibits,
        literature and films at the fair.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">This event is free to students and
        there will be a tee shirt raffle.</font></p>
