        President of Columbus State University has been with the
        university for 16 years. </font><p><font size="4">Since
        coming aboard in 1981 he has held the position of vice
        president for business and finance, and associate
        professor of management. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">In January of 1988 Dr. Brown was
        picked, out of 100 applicants, by faculty, students,
        staff, other community members and the Board of Regents
        to be president of what was then Columbus College. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">CSU has a major role in the Columbus
        community. In 1996, he was an essential part of the
        process that lead Columbus College to become Columbus
        State University.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">After high school Dr. Brown was
        accepted to the University of Southern Mississippi on a
        music scholarship. He was active with USM&#146;s marching
        band and aiming for a degree in business administration
        with plans to go into human resources. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Brown reported that he was off to a
        &#147;slow start&#148;, but quickly found his niche. He
        even made the Dean&#146;s list a few times. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">After receiving his degree in 1963 he
        opted for a career in computer programming instead of
        human resources management. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">In 1969 he received his MBA from the
        University of Alabama and went to work for IBM. &#147;At
        the end of a working day I had the feeling that I had not
        made a difference in peoples lives,&#148; he says. He
        also says, &#147;I really wanted to - that&#146;s why I
        went back to school for my PhD.&#148; </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">He received his PhD in higher education
        administration in 1974 from Florida State University. He
        joined the Alabama Commission on Higher Education
        teaching pupils at State level and moved on to become
        Chief Financial Officer at the University of Houston. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Finally, in 1981, he joined CSU. He is
        the link between the university and the Board of Regents
        and takes care of future administrative planning as well
        as budget planning. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">His favorite parts of being president
        are being able to award scholarships, taking part in
        graduation ceremonies, and the dedication of buildings
        such as the clubhouse of the baseball stadium and the
        Japanese Garden given to CSU by Japan. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">As for the future of CSU, Brown says,
        &#147;The future looks extremely bright. So many positive
        things have happened and continue to happen. But it didn&#146;t
        happen automatically. All success came about through hard
        work and planning.&#148; He went on to explain that
        &#147;CSU enjoys great support from its community.
        Without that support our ability to accomplish great
        things would be extremely diminished.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Brown has been married to his wife
        Jo-Ann for 30 years. They have two children, April, who
        is a Junior at CSU, and Jay, who is a freshman enrolled
        at Carson Newman College in Tennessee. In his free time
        Dr. Brown loves to do yard work in his flower garden,
        spend quality time with his family, or read. He is also a
        genuine animal lover and a supporter of the Muscogee
        County Humane Society.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Brown says the best advice he can give
        to students at Columbus State University to be prepared
        for the &#147;real world&#148;, is &#147;Concentrate on
        course work, do well, however, also be involved and
        active within the community. Grades are primary but they
        are only a part of the student&#146;s experience in
        college.&#148; </font></p>
