        <p><font size="4"><strong>by Athena Curry /
        Editor-in-Chief</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;CSU is an appropriate
        place to talk about the number one priority of expanding
        access to education and training,&#148; Vice President Al
        Gore said during a speech Monday given at Columbus State
        University (CSU) in the Woodruff Gymnasium. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Gore complimented CSU for
        pioneering ICAPP and congratulated Georgia on the success
        of the HOPE scholarship program. &#147;The beauty of HOPE
        is it has the flexibility to serve the whole state,&#148;
        Gore said. He also praised Georgia for leading the nation
        in creating high tech jobs and said he hopes the rest of
        the nation follows. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong><img src="030998/030998greetgore.jpg" align="right" hspace="0" width="254" height="210"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>&#147;You&#146;ve
        got the kind of partnership here with Columbus State
        University, Total Systems, the private sector and
        government under Zell Miller that is exciting the whole
        nation,&#148; Gore said. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>During the speech Gore stressed
        the importance of education and knowledge. &#147;We are
        in a new and different age, the information age and the
        strategic resource of the information age is
        knowledge,&#148; Gore said. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Several audience members
        laughed and clapped when Gore shared that his first home
        was a trailer in Alabama.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The crowd also cheered when he
        commented that he thought Columbus did a great job of
        hosting the SEC tournament.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Many students who attended the
        speech were pleased with Gore&#146;s comments. &#147;He
        was more interesting than I thought he would be,&#148;
        says CSU student, Lisa Rios. &#147;I didn&#146;t even
        know what ICAPP was exactly until now. I was suitably
        impressed.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Rios also commented that she
        was pleased that the speech was clear and concise.
        &#147;I was really glad he spoke a lot about CSU. I was
        glad he didn&#146;t waste a lot of time talking about
        things I wasn&#146;t interested in.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Andy Manuel, CSU student, says,
        &#147;I liked it. It was interesting to hear what the
        Vice President had to say about ICAPP. It was positive
        for everyone involved.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The speech was given before a
        banner which read, &#147;Columbus State University, 21st
        Century Education, 21st Century Jobs&#148;. Gore
        addressed about 600 CSU faculty, students, business
        leaders and political guests. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Gore shared the stage with CSU
        President Frank Brown, Representative Sanford Bishop,
        Senator Max Cleland, Secretary of Education Richard
        Riley, Governor Zell Miller, Mayor Bobby Peters, State
        Senator Calvin Smyre and CSU student Kristen Fenty. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Brown welcomed the audience and
        said, &#147;The eyes of the nation will be on Columbus
        today, not a bad situation to be in.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Cleland began his remarks by
        saying, &#147;We are gathering today at one of
        Georgia&#146;s great institutions.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Of the ICAPP tour, Riley said,
        &#147;Partnership at work and anything that works well
        has the word partnership in it. &#147; Secretary Riley
        also said &#147; I am so delighted to see ICAPP at work .
        ICAPP is making a big difference in people lives.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Shortly before the speech, Gore
        participated in a roundtable discussion with between 15
        and 20 university, business and state leaders and 2 CSU
        students. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Fenty, who introduced Governor
        Zell Miller at the Vice President&#146;s speech was
        present at the roundtable discussion. She says, &#147;I
        really enjoyed myself. He was a lovely man. In fact, the
        entire panel enjoyed themselves.&#148; A member of the
        first graduating ICAPP class, Fenty says she was
        surprised to hear that Gore was planning a visit to CSU. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Fenty is a graduate student at
        CSU and was chosen to attend the roundtable discussion
        through contacts at her job with Total Systems Services,
        Inc. (TSYS). She agrees with Gore&#146;s praise of the
        program and says, &#147;I could not have the job I have
        now without ICAPP.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>After the roundtable discussion
        Gore visited a class of Intellectual Capital Partnership
        Program (ICAPP) students. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>ICAPP students waited for
        almost an hour for Gore&#146;s arrival. While walking
        into the classroom, Gore shook hands and spoke to
        students. He sat with one student at a computer while she
        explained the program.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Before Gore&#146;s
        approximately 3 hour visit, various people on campus were
        busy preparing for his arrival since last Thursday.
        Several Secret Service were on campus to scout for a
        suitable place to hold the event. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>While Gore was here the
        Columbus Police Department, the Sheriff&#146;s Department
        and the CSU Public Safety Office joined the Secret
        Service in helping to keep the Vice President safe.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Woodruff Gymnasium was searched
        by Secret Service agents and bomb detecting dogs before
        Gore entered. Extreme safety measures were taken and one
        student standing on a nearby tennis court was reportedly
        asked by a Service Agent to return a tennis ball to his
        athletic bag before the Vice President arrived.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Gore ended his speech by
        joking, &#147;the nation has already stolen the HOPE
        program from Georgia and we are now laying the groundwork
        for stealing ICAPP&#148;.</strong></font></p>
