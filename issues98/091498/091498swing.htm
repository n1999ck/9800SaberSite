        <td><font size="4"><strong>As you may or may not know,
        swing is coming back in a big way. Since the 1920&#146;s
        and &#145;30&#146;s it has made changes some might say is
        for the better. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>From
        BIG bands like the Royal Crown Revue, Big Bad Voodoo
        Daddies, Cherri Poppin Daddies, and the Brian Setzer
        Orchestra comes new bold sounds that are sure to keep the
        spirit of swing alive in the &#145;90&#146;s. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Swing just isn&#146;t about
        music, however. It&#146;s about dance and an overall
        frame of mind. You might ask, &#147;How do I learn all
        about swing in a short time?&#148; or even &#147;Where do
        I pick up my zoot-suit daddio?&#148; To answer your
        questions, I&#146;ve compiled a list of how to become a
        swingin&#146; fool in the &#145;90&#146;s.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>1. Start off by renting the
        movie &#147;Swingers.&#148; This will give you a good
        idea about the everyday lifestyle of a modern-day
        swinger. Besides, it&#146;s a great movie and should be
        watched regardless.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>2. Go ahead and pick up a CD of
        a modern swing band like the Big Bad Voodoo Daddies (they&#146;re
        my favorite). Another option to get an overall taste of
        modern swing music is a compilation that recently hit
        stores called &#147;Swing This Baby&#148;.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>3. Take swing lessons. There
        aren&#146;t a whole lot of places in Columbus that teach
        swing, but the places that do are good in quality. Call
        around to area dance studios and find out how to enroll.
        A few places that you can check out here around town that
        can help you learn how to swing dance: the Rivertown
        Dance Theatre, Ballroom Dancing by Gloria Harris, and the
        Dance Centre of Cross Country Plaza.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Once you&#146;ve followed these
        steps you might want to consider going to a club that
        offers a swing night. The Masquerade in Atlanta offers
        this delicacy every Sunday night. In fact I even saw a
        sign at Scooters announcing the possibility of a swing
        night. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Now that you have completed all
        of the steps, your on the way to becoming a very cool
        cat. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Don&#146;t forget, &#147;It don&#146;t
        mean a thing if you ain&#146;t got that swing!&#148; </strong></font></p>
