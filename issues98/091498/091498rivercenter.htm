        downtown area of Columbus, children and adults began to
        come from miles around to witness one of the many
        advancements in Columbus State University history. The
        groundbreaking festivities for the new $60 million
        RiverCenter were like no other. </strong></font><p><img src="091498rivercenter.jpg" align="right" hspace="0" width="418" height="297"><font size="4"><strong>The
        entertainment brought joy to the many people who were
        gathered in the downtown area of 10th Street and
        Broadway. Some of the acts consisted of a great puppet
        show which provided entertainment for the children who
        were in attendance. There was without a doubt plenty of
        food and fun for everyone there. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The Columbus State University
        Wind Ensemble was also present and performed two works
        for the event. There were other events taking place as
        well which kept the people dancing until the big moment.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Finally, the festivities
        concluded with the groundbreaking ceremonies in which Dr.
        Frank Brown, President of CSU, participated along with
        the RiverCenter Board of Directors. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>This was a great moment for CSU
        as it took yet another exciting step toward the future.
        The new facility will allow Columbus to host
        international acts, touring dance, children&#146;s
        theatre and many other exciting events. It will also
        house both the Schwob Department of Music and the
        Columbus Symphony Orchestra. </strong></font></p>
