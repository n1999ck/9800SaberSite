        arrived with their second album last week, and to be
        honest with you, it is awesome. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;Celebrity Skin&#148; offers twelve
        tracks of music that is definitely a step up from their
        previous efforts. Billy Corgan, of Smashing Pumpkins,
        offers his assistance on several tracks of the album, but
        his touch is heard throughout the entire album. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The music leans toward more of
        a poppy-techno sound than the previous albums by the
        band. Hole is Courtney Love, Erik Erlandson, Melissa Auf
        Maur, and Patty Schemel. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The band performed at the MTV
        Video Music Awards last week and is planning a tour to
        promote their new project. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>A standout song on the album is
        track number nine, &#147;Boys On The Radio,&#148; which
        is a reworking of the older Hole song called &#147;Sugar
        Coma,&#148; which the band played several years ago on
        MTV Unplugged. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&gt;&gt; Singer and songwriter
        Duncan Sheik will release his second album, &#147;Humming,&#148;
        on October 6. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>A highlight of that album is
        sure to be a track dedicated to the late Jeff Buckley.
        Sheik wrote &#147;A Body Goes Down,&#148; a memorial for
        Buckley, who drowned while swimming in the Mississippi
        River in May 1997. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Matt Johnson of The The plays
        drums for that song, which is appropriate because Johnson
        played on Buckley&#146;s first record, &#147;Grace.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&gt;&gt; U2 has signed a
        multi-million dollar deal with Polygram Records to put
        out a series of &#145;best of&#146; albums, according to
        MTV News and several other internet sources. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The first two albums are
        scheduled to be released November 2. The first is
        tentatively titled &#147;The Best Of U2: Volume One
        1980-1990&#148; and will have around 15 tracks. It will
        be accompanied by a separate B-sides set, which may
        appear as part of a limited edition double set or as a
        separate release all together. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;Best of Volume Two&#148;
        will probably arrive either the next Christmas or
        sometime thereafter. </strong></font></p>
