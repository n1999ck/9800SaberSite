    <td><font size="4"><strong>After a long season of bumps and bruises, both emotionally and
    physically, the Columbus Cottonmouths won the Central Hockey League championship and
    brought to Columbus it’s first hockey championship.</strong><p><strong>After winning the
    first two championship series games in the Snake Pit, Columbus travelled to Witchita,
    Kansas where they systematically tore down the Thunder and went on to sweep Witchita to
    claim the title.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The Cottonmouths organization prides themselves as having the best fans in the
    CHL and their beliefs were made solid as steel when the team returned home from Kansas.
    After being flown in two separate flights to Atlanta, the team loaded into vans provided
    by the Columbus Parks &amp; Recreation and began their journey home.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>As the team team approached Columbus, they were met by a police escort. While
    the team approached, a large contingent of fans had gathered on the side of the Columbus
    Civic Center and were already breaking into cheers as reports of the Cottonmouths location
    was announced over the PA system. “I knew we would have fans because that’s just the way
    they are, but this is incredible,” stated an enthusiastic head coach Bruce Garber. What
    was incredible was a mob of nearly 1000 crazed fans armed with bags of confetti and silly
    string. As the players arrived they made they way down a narrow path and were showered
    with all sorts of fun party favors. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Once on the stage, the players looked out across the screaming fans and many
    had a look of utter amazement on their faces. When asked what he thought of the huge
    crowd, goalie Frankie Oulette said, “Unbelievable, never in a million years, it’s just
    unbelievable.” </strong></p>
    <p><strong>As the crowd settled down, each player gave a quick speech, beginning with team
    captain Jerome “Boom Boom” Bechard, who carried the Levins Cup trophy proudly. As the
    team went down the numerical roster, some danced, some thanked the fans, and some spoke of
    former Cottonmouths owner Charlie Morrow who died of cancer earlier in the year. One of
    the most emotional speeches came from General Manager Phil Roberto. Roberto, fighting off
    tears and a quivering voice, hoisted the Levens Cup skyward, looked up and simply said,
    “Charlie, we did it.” </strong></p>
    <p><strong>When all the speeches were said and done, the players were given a bottle of
    champagne each and they promptly began spraying the fans with the cold liquid. They then
    left the stage and walked directly into the new celebrity status that each individual has
    acquired.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The celebration showed just how much the Cottonmouths mean to the fans of
    Columbus and if the team has their way, there will be more celebrations like that one in
    the future. This thought was made apparent as Roberto led the fans in a chant of Repeat,
    Repeat, Repeat.</strong></font></td>
