    new album, Adore, set for release on June 1st. The single is available on cd, cassette and
    limited 7-inch vinyl. &quot;Ava Adore&quot; is accompanied by a new song, ‘Czarina', on
    the 7-inch single, while the cd and cassette also include the extra track &quot;Once In A
    While&quot;. Both tracks are only available on the single. </strong><p><strong>The
    Smashing Pumpkins will be playing in London at Shepherd’s Bush Empire on May 23rd. The
    concert will be the band's first appearance overseas since headlining Glastonbury last
    year and will kick off a special MTV &quot;5 Night Stand&quot; show. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>The new album, Adore, is The Smashing Pumpkins fourth studio album and the
    follow up to 1995's critically acclaimed Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness. This
    multi-million selling album won many awards including a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock
    Performance, 7 MTV Video Music Awards and Album Of The Year awards in both Time and
    Rolling Stone magazines. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>The track listing for Adore is as follows: &quot;To Sheila&quot;, &quot;Ava
    Adore&quot;, &quot;Perfect Daphne Descends&quot;, &quot;Once Upon A Time&quot;,
    &quot;Tear&quot;, &quot;Crestfallen&quot;, &quot;Appels + Oranjes&quot;, &quot;Pug&quot;,
    &quot;The Tale of Dusty and Pistol Pete&quot;, &quot;Annie-Dog&quot;, &quot;Shame&quot;,
    &quot;Behold! The Night Mare&quot;, &quot;For Martha&quot;, and &quot;Blank Page&quot;. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>It is rumored that the band has decided on a drummer for its upcoming 10-week
    tour. It could be studio genius Kenny Aronoff. He is best known for his long alliance with
    John Mellencamp and was most recently drumming for singer John Fogerty, whose current tour
    Aronoff just left to join the Pumpkins. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>The band will also borrow violinist Lisa Germano from John Mellencamp's band
    for their tour. The highly anticipated album from Billy Corgan, James Iha and D'Arcy is
    due out in June.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>**** Congratulations to Melissa Etheridge and girlfriend Julie Cypher. The
    couple is expecting, Cypher is carrying the child, their second child. Their first child,
    Bailey Jean, was born in February of 1997. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Etheridge and Cypher plan to have three children. Melissa is currently in Los
    Angeles working on her new album that is due out in January of 1999. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>**** First he was called Osiris. Then it was Ol' Dirty Bastard. Now he wants to
    be called Big Baby Jesus. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>The Wu-Tang Clan member told MTV, &quot;I always been Jesus. I don't know what
    the big secret's been all these years. Hanging pictures up on the walls, and crosses and
    things of that nature, I mean, it's all good, but the truth's gunna be revealed one
    day.&quot; </strong></p>
    <p><strong>It really sounds like the &quot;Artist Currently Searching For Ways to Hide His
    Lack of Talent&quot; is grasping at straws to stay in the music spotlight. Just months ago
    he stormed the stage at the Grammy Awards, after not winning anything, and interrupted a
    speech by Shawn Colvin. What was his important message for everyone? He wanted to comment
    on his new suit and tell how good his band is. That is all I saw before scrambling for the
    remote to change channel. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>**** Here's some actual music related news. The new cd from the Lilith Fair
    tour is now in stores. The album, Lilith Fair: A Celebration of Women in Music , is a live
    double album. Featured on the cd are: Paula Cole, Indigo Girls, Abra Moore, Lisa Loeb,
    Suzanne Vega, Sarah McLachlan, Jewel, Shawn Colvin, and Victoria Williams. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>**** In news that thoroughly excites me, the Titanic soundtrack has been
    knocked off the number one spot in the charts. The big boat soundtrack fell to number
    three, with the soundtrack to City Of Angels taking number two. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Number one was taken by the Dave Matthews Band with their new album,
    &quot;Before These Crowded Streets.&quot; Dave and company managed to sell over 420,000
    copies of the new album in the first week of its release. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>This victory by &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot; marks the first non-
    Titanic number one in five months. It's about time. </strong></font></td>
