    recent accusation against one of Columbus State's fraternities has brought to light the
    thoughts that hazing is talking place on campus. Although the event passed without any
    serious effects on that chapter or the CSU Greek system, the controversy had the potential
    to form a black cloud over all of CSU's Greek organizations.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The event in question was reported about two weeks ago when several CSU
    students say they witnessed members of the Sigma Nu fraternity forcing one of it's pledges
    to drink large amounts of alcohol at a local establishment. All sources wish to remain
    anonymous. The fraternity vehemently denied the accusations against them. I'm not one to
    pass judgement, especially since I didn't witness the event and facts tend to get mixed
    and jumbled as they pass around from person to person. However, the event, whether it
    happened or not, should serve as a strong warning to that fraternity and all other greek
    organizations at CSU.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>All organizations should be aware of the consequences against them and other
    campus groups when a controversial situation like this takes place. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Should this event have become a serious situation where the news groups of the
    area made it public, the reputation of the university would be tarnished, along with the
    other greek organizations on campus. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>All fraternities and sororities would be examined for hazing, whether they've
    been accused or not. A serious situation could also cause a decline in all groups new
    members. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Students coming to CSU who were informed of the hazing would steer clear of
    greek organizations in fear of being hazed themselves.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The point of this whole editorial is to say, WATCH OUT. When you are out in the
    community as a member of a fraternity or sorority, people see nearly everything you do.
    Many citizens and students already have the stereotype of fraternities and sororities as
    being violent hazers. Let's not give people any excuse to prove these stereotypes to be
    true. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Take care of your brother's and sister's and think of the reputation of the
    university, your organization, and the entire CSU greek system when considering taking
    part in any kind of dangerous activity. </strong></font></td>
