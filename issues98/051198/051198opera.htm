    <td><font size="4"><strong>CSU to present Puccini's Suor Angelica and Gianni Schicci Guest
    artists join local talent to perform two one-act operas.</strong><p><strong>Sandra Walker
    of New York City's Metropolitan Opera Joins Columbus State University's Schwob Department
    of Music in its presentation of Suor Angelica and Gianni Schicci, two of the three one-act
    operas that comprise Puccini's Il Trittico. Performances are scheduled for Friday, May 29
    at 8 p.m. and Sunday, May 31 at 4 p.m. in Fine Arts Hall.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Local opera buffs will enjoy both comic and tragic opera in one performance.
    According to Joseph Golden, professor of opera at CSU, Gianni Schicci depicts the evils of
    greed and is one of the &quot;finest examples of Italian comic opera ever written.&quot;
    This production will be sung in English and set in modern day Florence. Suor Angelica is
    &quot;traditional, heart-breakingly beautiful, and tragic,&quot; says Golden. It tells the
    story of a young, unwed girl who gives up her son to live in a convent in the 15th
    century. Both operas present life lessons that are as current as this morning's news.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Walker, a world famous Contralto who is currently appearing at the Metropolitan
    Opera in New York City, will sing the part of La Zia Principessa in Suor Angehca. Walker
    and her husband reside in Augusta where she has one of the largest private voice studios
    in the Southeast. Walker will be on campus May 22-31. CSU students will have the
    opportunity to talk with her and gain some first-hand knowledge of her experiences on the
    major opera stages of Western Europe and the United States. Joining her on stage is tenor
    Scott Berry, guest artist from New York City, who sings the part of Rinuccio in Gianni
    Schicci.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Local performers are represented in both casts. CSU graduates Kimberly
    Humphries and Bart Eysel sing the parts of Nella and Simone in Gianni Schicci. Student
    Erin Chancellor appears as Suor Genovieffa in Suor Angelica. They join a cast that
    includes CSU faculty members Shirley Brumbaugh as Zita and Robert Peavler in the title
    role of Gianni Schicci. Patricio Cobos conducts the orchestra for Gianni Schicci; Robert
    Rumbelow conducts for Suor Angelica.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>According to Golden, the operas have wonderful music, allowing the
    &quot;orchestra to fit seamlessly with the plot.&quot; In addition, &quot;every word sung
    is essential and serves to move the plot straight through to the moral of the story.&quot;
    Golden is impressed with his cast, which includes a number of freshmen. &quot;Often
    freshmen have a tendency to be afraid their first time on an opera stage, but this cast
    exhibits enthusiasm in all corners.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Sets are designed by Peter Cranton and built by Rich Scenery and Lighting, who
    also does the lighting for the production. Costumes are coordinated by Steven Graver,
    professor in the CSU theatre department. CSU presents one operatic production each year
    which is &quot;well attended and enjoys a tremendous amount of community support,&quot;
    says Golden, a faculty member since 1990.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Admission for all performances is by reserved seating only: $12 adults, $10
    senior citizens, $6 ages 18 and under, $8 group (8 or more), $15 at the door. For more
    information, call the CSU Box Office, (706) 569-3179.</strong></font><font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2"></p>
