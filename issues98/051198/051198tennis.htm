    <td><font size="4"><strong>How tough is it to win in tennis this year in the Peach Belt
    Athletic Conference? Extremely tough, considering 8 of the men’s teams and 5 of the
    women’s teams are ranked in the top 25 in Division II. </strong><p><strong>Columbus State
    is among these teams, the women are ranked 10th in the country and the men are ranked 24th
    nationally. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Gearing up for the the regional tournament, the men faced a tough
    non-conference contender in Abraham Baldwin College out of Tifton, GA. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Although, ABAC is a Junior College they are a regular opponent of many four
    year schools. Rightfully so, after having won the Junior College National Championship in
    1984 and defeating the University of Georgia in 1990. However, the Cougars came out on top
    with a 5 - 4 victory.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The results were not as positive this past week as the men were soundly
    defeated by Auburn University at Montgomery 7-2 and the women lost to Brenau by the same
    margin. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Regardless, both are in the regional championship which begins on Friday and
    runs through Sunday. The men will play the University of North Florida in Jacksonville and
    the women will play Mississippi University for Women at Georgia College in Milledgeville.</strong></font></td>
