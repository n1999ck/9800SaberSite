    throughout the year and this past weekend at Bull Creek, the CSU golf team is eyeing a
    seventh Division II National Championship. </strong><p><strong>Out of 12 tournaments
    throughout 97 and 98, the team has finished first place 4 times, in the top 10, eleven
    times, and only once in the top twenty at 17th. This is impressive considering some of the
    tournaments included Division I schools. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>All of this culminated this past weekend at Bull Creek where the Cougars shot a
    14 under par 562, edging 2nd place finisher USC Aiken by nineteen strokes. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Leading the way for CSU was the overall winner, Jaco Rall who finished at 9
    under par and finishing a close second was William Hamilton at 3 under par.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The next tournament is the South Atlantic Regional, May 4 - 6 at Auburn Links. </strong></font></td>
