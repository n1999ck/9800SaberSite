    <td><font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2"></font><font size="4"><strong>These days the only
    time you read or hear about Fraternities it is for excessive partying or unsafe Initiation
    practices, we think it's only fair to look at the other side of the picture - the good we
    do for the community.</strong><p><strong>701 - that is an awesome number, and what makes
    it more impressive is that it is the number of hours Tau Kappa Epsilon put forth for
    community service this last year. That is over a month's worth of time!! At last week's
    Greek Banquet Sigma Nu walked away with the award for winning Greek Week Congrats!
    But...Tau Kappa Epsilon walked away with the award that we feel Is the real prize the
    award for philanthropy. The award for most community service hours. Tau Kappa Epsilon is
    very very proud to win this award and show our critics that Fraternities do more than
    drink and fight.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Tau Kappa Epsilon picks up hours throughout the year, but there are a couple of
    events that we are especially proud of-, for the last 10 years we have worked hand in hand
    with the Roosevelt Rehab Hospital in war-in springs. Once a year the have black tie
    charities ball to raise money for the hospital. We will show up on Friday afternoon and
    help with anything we can. Then on Saturday we all dress in shirt and tie and we serve as
    car valets, bar tenders, and general gophers. The other event Tau Kappa Epsilon would like
    to mention is for the first time this year we worked with the Miss Wheelchair Georgia
    Pageant here at the Liberty Theatre. It was our first year associated with the pageant,
    but definitely not our last. We even received a letter of recognition from the mayor.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Tau Kappa Epsilon is very proud of what we are and how we achieved that status.
    We will continue to be In the news sharing with the public our good works in the community
    and the surrounding areas. As for upcoming events we have been asked to work with the
    Roosevelt Hospital this summer at the Special Olympic trials to be held in Warm springs
    this July.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>The credibility of the Saber is in question when an article directly slanders
    the credibility of a student and an organization on campus. There is no way on God's green
    earth that the shallow minded individual who wrote that article could be in the least bit
    sane in any sense of the word. I feel that a name should have been left with the article
    to test the metal of his/her accusation and the sanity of the individual. It sure makes me
    feel good that I can use the Saber to blast any person or organization I want and not put
    my name on it so I won't get in hot water! Hey, if you really want to produce a credible
    paper, look at your sources and ask yourself are the accusations they make really true
    BEFORE publishing and article. By the way, who wrote the article? Is the author on staff
    at the Saber? Was the author patronizing a bar where you have to be 21 to enter? Was the
    author in the establishment drinking underage? Who is the author referring to in the
    article? Is the author afraid of the repercussions of his/her allegations or is the Saber
    just a puppet for people angry and have no identity and never will? My name is on this
    complaint. As far as anyone can see, the name on that article are the names of everyone on
    the Saber staff who contribute articles for print. Is this journalism?</strong></p>
