        <td><font size="4">Graduate student Dorion Williams
        relieved a Houston Sports Medical Scholarship recently.
        The scholarship recognized William&#146;s potential to be
        a future community leader. Williams wrote an essay, which
        focused on giving back to the community, in order to win
        the scholarship.</font><p><font size="5"><img src="12698dorion.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="136" height="186"></font><font size="4">Williams
        graduated CSU with a bachelor&#146;s degree in psychology
        and is now a graduate student majoring in public
        administration with an emphasis in student personnel. He
        is graduate assistant of minority affairs on campus and
        works as a trainer and assistant supervisor at Total
        Systems. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Williams is a well known, well
        respected and well liked figure on the CSU campus. CSU
        student ,Bryan Kirby, says, &#147;He&#146;s [Williams] a
        real good friend and fun to hang out with.&#148; </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Allison Rost, CSU student says of
        Williams, &#147;He&#146;s a super guy. Really laid
        back.&#148; Both Kirby and Rost agree that Williams is
        the kind of person that makes friends easily.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Although many on campus have nice
        things to say about Williams&#146; friendly disposition,
        they also stress the dedication he shows in the
        organizations he is involved in. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Kirby says that Williams is definitely
        a driving force behind the success of the Student
        Programming Council. He says, &#147;Dorion is great at
        getting entertainment events going.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Aside from his work with the Student
        Programming Council as an undergraduate, Williams is a
        member of Summus. Summus is an organization for minority
        men which focuses on keeping young men in school. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Recently, the Summus men volunteered
        their time tutoring at Eastway Elementary School.
        Williams says of the students involved in Summus,
        &#147;They&#146;re really making us proud.&#148; </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Williams is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha
        fraternity and a member of Masonic Lodge 697. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">He serves as a liaison between
        community youth and the mentoring program, Men of Action.
        Williams says, &#147;We stress commitment and strength to
        young people.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Despite the success he has achieved in
        the last several years, Williams was not always so
        motivated, &#147;I chose to make F&#146;s during my first
        two years of high school. A counselor told me that I
        couldn&#146;t get a College Preparatory diploma.&#148; </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Williams says that being told he could
        not do something made him more determined. &#147;I hit a
        brick wall and it&#146;s been an upward climb ever
        since,&#148; he says.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Williams graduated with the College
        Preparatory diploma and came to CSU. He says it was a big
        transition for him because the students at the Jr. High
        School and High School he attended were predominately
        African Americans. Williams says coming to CSU was a
        great chance to get to know other cultures and meet
        people who were different in some ways than himself. He
        also says it was a shock to be in such a new environment.
        &#147;The environment here teaches you that you have to
        understand cultural differences. [Coming to CSU] Was the
        best thing that ever happened to me.&#148; </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Williams offers advice to others,
        &#147;I&#146;ve been through a lot. If I can do it anyone
        can. Go by your word.&#148; </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">He says his mother and father have been
        a big influence in his life as well as his older brother.
        &#147;My big brother kept knocking me in the head,
        telling me I could do anything,&#148; Williams says. <br>
        Upon earning his graduate degree Williams plans to work
        in a job that involves working with college students in
        building new programs. Williams says, &#147;I have a plan
        laid out to give back.&#148;</font></p>
