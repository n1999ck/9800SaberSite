        <td><font size="4">The CSU theatre department is
        currently involved in the well received production of Tom
        Behm&#146;s &#147;Tarheel Tales&#148;. &#147;Tarheel
        Tales&#148; is a children&#146;s theatre play based on
        five folk tales centered around the Carolina&#146;s.
        Although very entertaining for children with its colorful
        costumes and audience participation, &#147;Tarheel
        Tales&#148; also presents children with the concept of
        right and wrong somewhat like that of Aesop&#146;s
        Fables. </font><p><font size="4">The six cast members who
        are all theatre majors find themselves engaged in a new
        but rewarding touring production. The set of
        &#147;Tarheel Tales&#148; is disassembled and reassembled
        for every production. Stage and tour manager Jeff Camp,
        who also designed the set is said to have had few
        problems with having to tote around an entire set in the
        mere confines of a van. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The cast members are Shaun Fuller,
        Kellie Lamb, Jennifer Todd, Jenny Newell, Melissa Walker,
        and William Enis. When speaking with William Enis he
        pointed out how much audience participation and pantamine
        are essential for keeping the children focused while
        entertaining. Enis also says how enjoyable &#147;Tarheel
        Tales&#148; is to perform with its complete ensemble
        having six cast members playing different parts for the
        average length of fifty-five minutes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Tarheel&#146;s first stop on the their
        city wide schedule of elementary schools was Blanchard
        Elementary where they were welcomed by hundreds of
        enthusiastic children ranging in grades from Pre-K
        through third grade. Mrs. Rochelle Jones, principal for
        Blanchard elementary comments, &#147;Students and
        teachers alike really enjoyed the show. The audience was
        very attentive and responded very well to the
        presentation, and more importantly the children
        understood the messages behind the stories&#148;.
        &#147;Tarheel&#146;s Tales&#148; offers children exposure
        to semi-professional theatre that otherwise they may not
        know. &#147;Tarheel Tales&#148; will be touring
        throughout the month and will end production in early
        March. </font></p>
