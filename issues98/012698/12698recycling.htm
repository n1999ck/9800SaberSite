        <td><font size="4">Have you seen blue containers sitting
        around campus lately? Have you wondered what they are for
        as you stumbled across them at 7:45 one morning last
        week? The Tri Beta Honor Society of the CSU Biology
        Department is determined to keep our campus clean and do
        their part in preserving nature. They have launched a
        campus-wide recycling campaign for aluminum cans and
        covered all grounds to make access convenient for CSU
        students to dispose of their empty aluminum cans.</font><p><font size="4">This project is not new but is an expansion of a
        project that has been ongoing in LeNoir Hall since </font><font size="5"><img src="12698recycling.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="300" height="360"></font><font size="4">1992 when Tri Beta&#146;s brainchild was first
        born. The project worked well and now has been expanded
        campus- wide. Members of the Honor Society are assigned
        to each of these barrels and are responsible for emptying
        the containers three times per week. The monies made with
        this effort has so far been used to finance the
        initiation ceremonies of the Society. However, if
        expansion results in greater income the money may even be
        used to finance student research equipment and for travel
        expenses to scientific meetings. The barrels were donated
        by Kinnett and painted blue by Tri Beta members before
        distributing them all over campus. </font></p>
