        <td><font size="4">In the last few months new gazebos
        have been spotted around campus. Some people have asked
        the purpose of these structures. Students have come to
        think of them as a smoking area. The Plant Operations and
        Landscaping Depart-ment say the gazebos serve several
        purposes.</font><p><font size="5"><img src="12698Gazebo.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="300" height="188"></font><font size="4">Recently a
        new rule went into effect stating that no person can
        smoke within twenty feet of any building. This makes the
        new gazebos an alternative to standing in front of the
        buildings to have a cigarette. The gazebos were not a
        direct response to the smoking issue, but it just so
        happened their placement was at the same time of the
        placement of the new smoking rule.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Another reason was to help improve the
        look of the grounds on campus. Eddie Woodhouse, Assistant
        Director of Plant Operations, said, &#147;Developing
        areas other than classrooms for students to get away from
        stress and pressure is one of our goals. We have a
        beautiful campus and we want everybody to enjoy it.&#148;
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">There have been a number of problems
        with the gazebos as far students are concerned. Sophomore
        Jerri Lynn Hayes stated, &#147;They leak, and need to be
        glassed in so it will be warmer.&#148; She does, however,
        enjoy them and sits in them everyday. Hal Gibson,
        Director of Plant Operations, said that they had not
        received any complaints about the condition of the
        gazebos, but will look into it and see what can be done
        if any complaints arise. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The gazebos that were put up in several
        locations here on campus are just the beginning of the
        movement to beautify the grounds. This project is being
        overseen by the director of Plant Operations Hal Gibson,
        assistant director of Plant Operations Eddie Woodhouse,
        and Head of Landscaping Danella Lee.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The plan for landscaping the campus
        started in June and continues today. The plan is to
        develop more areas for students and professors to go to
        be able to relax and enjoy the outdoors. The clock tower
        and the area around Gentian Corner are the next areas to
        receive attention from the landscaping department.</font></p>
