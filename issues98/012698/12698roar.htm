        <p><font size="4">On Thursday, January 15th, the Office
        of Minority Affairs sponsored a program dedicated to the
        memory of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.. A small group of
        CSU students organized this event for the enrichment of
        the CSU student community. Those of you unfamiliar with
        Dr. King&#146;s philosophies would be given the chance to
        learn who this man was and what he stood for. Those of
        you who are aware of Dr. King&#146;s history would have
        the opportunity to reflect on the important role he has
        played in our lives. Rev. Dr. Robert Dickerson, Jr. was
        invited to speak to the students of CSU, but where were
        you?</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">I was disappointed, not to mention
        embarrassed, by the apathy shown by the students of this
        university. The number of empty seats were far greater
        than the number of students in attendance. I am aware
        that some of you had to go to class or work, but I
        don&#146;t understand why the rest of you didn&#146;t
        bother to come to the Columbus Room on Thursday. Did
        everyone suddenly have something better or more important
        to do? Did no one see the many signs and flyers hanging
        around campus, advertising this program? I imagine that
        if this had been a basketball game, the Blizzard of
        Bucks, or a cookout with free food there wouldn&#146;t
        have been an empty seat in the room. I would like to
        think that the CSU student community just doesn&#146;t
        understand the significance of Dr. King&#146;s
        contribution to our society. It would be sad to think
        that you just don&#146;t care.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. fought and
        died so that every youth might have an equal opportunity
        to succeed in life. It was his dream that people would be
        &#147;judged not by the color of their skin, but by the
        content of their character.&#148; Without the efforts of
        Dr. King, and other leaders like him, our society may
        still be segregated. Imagine a world where the color of
        your skin determined which restaurants you could eat in,
        which schools you could attend, which parts of town you
        could live in, or even which fountains you could drink
        from. This country may still have a long way to go before
        we achieve true racial harmony, but by learning about the
        past you can appreciate how far our society has come. It
        is for this reason that men like Dr. King should be
        remembered and honored.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">For those who weren&#146;t there, you
        missed a great program. You would have been moved by the
        remarks of the student speakers (Jason Jones, Kevin
        Sellers, and Maurice Williams), the poem read by Taesha
        Lewis, and the musical selections led by Shana Teel. The
        highlight of the program was an eloquent speech delivered
        by Rev. Dr. Robert M. Dickerson, Jr., pastor of the First
        African Baptist Church here in Columbus. We were urged
        not to forget the legacy of Dr. King. He also encouraged
        the audience to find and follow their own dreams.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">I hope all of you enjoyed your long
        weekend. The holiday was set aside to pay homage to one
        of the greatest men in American history. May those of you
        who didn&#146;t bother to attend the program take the
        time to learn more about Dr. King and his philosophies.
        You have a responsibility to yourself to not only have
        fun in college, but to broaden your knowledge and
        experience as well. Perhaps if you learn more about his
        accomplishments, you will be able to appreciate the
        significance of honoring his memory in these types of
        programs.</font></p>
