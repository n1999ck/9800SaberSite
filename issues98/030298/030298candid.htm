        Salter is one of the most active students on campus.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Originally from Thomaston,
        Georgia, Salter moved to Columbus and began attending CSU
        in the summer of 1996. He says he chose to attend CSU
        because it is a medium size college. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;I wanted to attend a
        college where I wouldn&#146;t get lost in the crowd, but
        still have opportunities,&#148; Salter says. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>To gain experience as an
        educator Salter decided to pursue his B.A. in Early
        Childhood Development. He plans to get his Masters in
        Public Administration and eventually work in the
        education field. &#147;Hopefully I will have a chance to
        work in the student development field at a University
        level, &#147; Salter says.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Aside from classes Salter is a
        leader on campus and a member of various organizations.
        He is an orientation leader, a Campus Organization
        Recruitment Excellence (CORE) member, Business Manager of
        the Saber and a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon. Salter also
        recently became the acting Vice President of Scholastic
        Affairs in SGA. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Salter says that working on
        camus is a very positive experience for him. &#147;I feel
        working with different organizations on campus has helped
        me grow, become a more effective communicator and assume
        a greater leadership role,&#148; he says.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Salter is presently working
        with the Leadership Curriculum Development Committee,
        which is attempting create leadership scholarships for
        CSU students. &#147;I feel the experience of leadership
        is an asset to any student. It is a difficult role and
        deserves to be rewarded.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Also, Salter is a member of the
        Ethics Week committee, which plans events, forums and
        panel discussions for CSU Ethics Week.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>As for the future of CSU Salter
        says, &#147;I really enjoyed seeing this school grow from
        a commuter college to a university and I&#146;m looking
        forward to seeing it continue to grow.&#148; </strong></font></p>
