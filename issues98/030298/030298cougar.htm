        <td><font size="4"><strong>After clinching the Peach
        Belt&#146;s regular season title, the Columbus State
        Cougars romped through the conference tournament to claim
        their third tournament championship and in the process,
        gained an automatic birth in the NCAA Div.II tournament.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong><img src="030298sportsnet.jpg" align="right" hspace="0" width="313" height="500"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>Columbus State traveled to Savannah,
        Georgia with high spirits and high expectations. As the
        number one seeded team, the Cougars received a bye to
        start off. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The first team to face the
        Cougars were the Clayton State Lakers. The Lakers, coming
        off an opening win against Lander, had a mere 12-15
        record and were swept by the Cougars in the regular
        season. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>In the game, senior Calvin Hill
        scored 24 points, nineteen of those in the second half as
        the Cougars took the quarter final matchup 81-76. Clayton
        State kept the game close in the first half and were down
        by only four at the break. Hill took charge in the second
        half as the Cougars jumped out to a twelve point lead and
        never looked back. Larry Coates added 16 points and
        Quinton Peterson scored 12.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>With the win Columbus advanced
        to face the third seeded Kennesaw State Owls. In that
        semi-final game the Cougars held Kennesaw to a pathetic
        17 percent (6 of 34) shooting performance in the first
        half and took a very easy victory, 82-69, and advanced to
        the tournament final. Columbus had five players in double
        figures in scoring, led by Coates and Jermaine Taylor,
        each with 17.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The final barrier in the way of
        a CSU championship were the second seeded Armstrong
        Atlantic Pirates, who had an immediate advantage by
        playing on their court in front of their students and
        fans. The Pirates led by as many as eight in the second
        half but Columbus State fought their way back by firing a
        barrage of three pointers and taking a 74-60 come from
        behind victory. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Coates, who was held scoreless
        in the first half, hit several key three pointers and
        finished the game with 14 points. Hill scored 17 points
        and was named the PBAC tournament MVP. </strong></font></p>
