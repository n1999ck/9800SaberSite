        University&#146;s School Counseling master&#146;s degree
        program has become one of three such programs in the
        state to earn national accreditation from the Council for
        Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational
        Programs (CACREP).</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>The
        designation signifies the program meeting the
        nation&#146;s highest preparation standards in the school
        counseling discipline. The criteria centers on
        leading-edge applications in technology, ethics and
        cultural diversity, says Lori Crutchfield, CSU assistant
        professor of counseling and clinical programs.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>CSU President Frank Brown says
        the designation reflects a high level of commitment by
        faculty. &#147;We are delighted that CSU&#146;s school
        counseling program has been recognized for its quality.
        Our faculty set high standards and have worked hard to
        make them a reality.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Joyce Hickson, department chair
        of counseling and clinical programs, says the
        accreditation stands to bring tremendous benefits.
        &#147;We improve our ability to attract top faculty and
        students.&#148; For graduates of the program, she adds,
        the status also means a reduction in the
        post-master&#146;s degree supervision requirement for
        licensure, from four to three years.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Thomas Harrison, dean of the
        CSU College of Education, says &#147;by adopting CACREP
        standards, the College of Education is stating to our
        students and the greater community that identifiable
        benchmarks of excellence are an integral part of our
        counseling program.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Georgia State University and
        the University of Georgia house the state&#146;s other
        such accredited programs.</strong></font></p>

        master&#146;s program includes 40 students while
        CSU&#146;s community counseling masters program,
        previously CACREP-accredited, serves 60 students.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;The College of Education
        is proud of the achievements of its counseling graduates
