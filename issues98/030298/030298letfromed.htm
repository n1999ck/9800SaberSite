        <td><font size="4"><strong>Seven years ago I was a new
        student at CSU. I was 18 years old, a new mother and at a
        very difficult point in my life. Personal circumstances
        left me insecure, alone and hopeless. Still, I wanted my
        college degree.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Many
        students here understand the difficulties of attending
        college while trying to raise a family. In my case, the
        problem was compounded by the fact that I was still a
        child myself. I wondered if things would ever get better
        in my life. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Something happened during that
        first year here that changed my life dramatically, and I
        remember it vividly. I was sitting in a History class in
        Howard Hall when I just broke down. I left the classroom
        in tears. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Before I could make it down the
        stairs I heard someone calling my name. It was my
        professor, Dr. Kayron M. Laska. I did not want her to see
        me crying, fearing I would be judged. I wanted to run
        away, but instead I turned to speak with her. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>We talked for a half hour. She
        told me that one day things would be better, that I would
        succeed, that I would make it. She reassured me about the
        future. We hugged and I went on my way.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>This professor and ones like
        her do more than give assignments, lecture and grade
        tests. They guide, console and relate to their students.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dr. Laska&#146;s advice and
        understanding helped me in a time of need. Although, I
        did drop out of school for a period until my son was old
        enough to start school himself. I returned as an adult,
        self assured, confident and ready to build a new life. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Of course, I still have bad
        days, even bad weeks. Everyone in school has those days
        when it seems impossible. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Last week my son was sick, my
        husband dropped four pages of notes I needed immediately
        for class behind the washer and I was late to class.
        Again, a professor came to my rescue. Dr. Alyce Cook,
        Professor of Language and Literature, comforted me and
        patted me on the back. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Professors do not get paid to
        be counselors, parents or psychologists to their
        students. However, many of them play one or all of those
        roles. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I have been fortunate to come
        across professors who go beyond the call of duty. When I
        leave Columbus State University I will have 4 years of
        college classes to carry with me and a lifetime of
        compassion. </strong></font></p>
