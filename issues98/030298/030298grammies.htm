        <td><font size="4"><strong>The 1998 Grammy Awards took
        place this week. Some winners were not a surprise but the
        show was not without them. One of the surprises of the
        evening was Bob Dylan taking the Award for Best
        Contemporary Folk Album for his release &#147;Time Out Of
        Mind.&#148; Bob Dylan also took home the award for Best
        Male Rock/Vocal Performance for his song &#147;Cold Irons
        Bound.&#148;</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Fiona
        Apple performed &#147;Criminal&#148;, and took the award
        for Best Female Rock/Vocal Performance. Jars of Clay,
        with their album &#147;Much Afraid&#148;, won the award
        for Best Pop/Rock Contemporary Gospel Album. Will Smith
        left with the award for Best Solo Rap Artist.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong><img src="030298grammy.jpg" align="right" hspace="0" width="315" height="300"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>The award for Best Long Form Music Video
        went to Alanis Morissette for her &#147;Jagged Little
        Pill, Live.&#148; Sarah McLachlan came away with two
        awards. She took home the awards for Best Female
        Pop/Vocal Perfor-mance for her song &#147;Building a
        Mystery&#148; and Best Pop Instrumental for her song
        &#147;Last Dance.&#148; Radio-head and their album
        &#147;OK Computer&#148; came away with the award for Best
        Alternative Performance. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>In an act that probably does
        not even deserve to be mentioned, Ol&#146; Dirty Bastard,
        of the Wu-Tang Clan pulled a stunt that was simply
        devised to call attention to himself and his group. As
        Shawn Colvin was about to receive her award for Song of
        the Year, ODB rushed the stage and took control of the
        microphone. He told the audience, &#147;I went out and
        bought me an outfit today that cost me a lot of money,
        because I figured that Wu-Tang was gonna win.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I am happy to report that
        Wu-Tang did not win and the award for Best Rap Album went
        to Puff Daddy. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Oasis is writing yet another
        chapter in their short, but volatile existence. The band
        is facing a possible ban from the Cathay Pacific Airline
        for several alleged reasons. Several of the things that
        the band is accused of doing on the eight hour flight
        include smoking, carrying on loud sing-alongs, using
        obscene language and gestures, and conducting food
        fights. Several witnesses claim that the band appeared to
        be drunk when they arrived for the flight.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Frontman Liam Gal-laugher
        responded, &#147;I didn&#146;t throw anything. I
        don&#146;t know what they are talking about. Some panhead
        told me to shut up - some panhead who needs stabbing
        through the head with a f***ing pick-ax.&#148; Guitar
        player and vocalist Noel Gallagher describes his younger
        brother, Liam, as having, &#147;twenty-four hour
        turbulence in his head.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Regardless of their actions off
        the stage, Oasis is at the top of their game when they
        step out on stage. The tour stopped in Atlanta several
        weeks ago and the band was phenomenal. The show included
        hits from all three of their albums and ended with a new
        song that might show up on a later album. The highlights
        of the show were a near ten minute version of
        &#147;Champaign Super-nova&#148;, a great version of the
        song &#147;Don&#146;t Go Away&#148;, and an acoustic
        version of the Beatles classic song &#147;Help.&#148;</strong></font></p>
