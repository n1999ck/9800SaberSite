    <td><font size="4">Better known for its cinematic version &#147;The Birdcage&#148;, La
    Cage Aux Folles is the Columbus State University Theatre&#146;s winter quarter production.
    Winner of the 1984 Tony Award, La Cage Aux Folles is based on the book by Harvey Fierstein
    with music and lyrics by Jerry Herman.</font><p><font size="4">The musical will run
    February 19, 20, 21, 26, 27, 28, at 8:00 PM and February 22 and March1 at 2:00 PM. Tickets
    are $15.00 <img src="020298lacage.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="197" height="305">for general admission and $12.00 non-CSU students, military, senior citizens
    and CSU alumni. All full- time CSU students, faculty and staff receive one free ticket.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">If you have any immediate questions or comments contact Dr. Hall or
    Steve Graver in the Department of Theatre. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">La Cage Folles presents many challenges for all involved in the
    production. Costume designer, Steve Graver is making over 60 costumes. Much of the
    materials were bought in Atlanta and some were even brought from New York. The costumes
    are the most notable part of the production, but Graver assures that even with a limited
    budget there will be no problems in creating Ziegfeld-style costumes. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">William Ennis, who is choreographer, says there is a great amount of
    skill needed to perform in a musical of this magnitude. &#147;Everyone is dancing in
    heels, and on top of that, it is really challenging vocally, especially with the guys who
    have to sing in really high ranges,&#148; says Ennis. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">It should also be noted that all male cast members had to shave there
    legs. Although Ennis has conceded to being a Nair man he describes the overall task of
    shaving with two words &#147;It itches.&quot; He would also like to say that through much
    deliberation it was unanimously agreed upon that, Phaedra played by Jason Pierce has the
    best legs in the troop and they look even better in hose. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">Although, most participants are Theatre majors, outside talent was
    necessary. La Cage Aux Folles is a difficult production to perform and requires a larger
    than average cast totaling 28 actors and actresses.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">The characters are: Georges, Bill Landen; Albin, Steve Valentini;
    Jean-Michael, Jody Walker; Francis, Troy Heard; Jacob, Eddye Santana; Anne Dindon,
    Jennifer Bruder; Eduard Dindon, Raymond Cambell; Marie Dindon, Jennifer Todd; M. Renaud,
    Bill Eldwood; Mme. Renaud, Molly Henderson; Jacqueline, Kellie Lamb; Chantal, Lewis
    Powell; Phaedra, Jason Pierce; Mercedes, William Ennis; Monique, Brantley Arrington;
    Derma, William Johnson; Nicole, Jennifer Bedsole; Bitelle, Alyssa Farmer; Odette, Jenny
    Newell; Angelique, Melissa Walker; Paulette, Christine Croteau; Hercule, Noel Reilly;
    Babette, Samantha Bottone; Etienne, Shaun Fuller; Colette, Joanna Poole; Tabarro, Matt
    Hamilton; Maitr&#146;D, Jason Williams. Stage manager for the production is Ryan Mays,
    assisted by Amber Dupriest and Jason Williams. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">La Cage Folles involves an older gay couple Albin and Georges who run a
    cabaret. George has a son, Jean-Michael, who is bringing home his bride to be, Anne, and
    her parents . The comedic conflict develops when it is discovered the brides father is the
    &#147;Minister of Morality&#148; who runs his political career on a ultra conservative
    platform. Jean-Michael persuades Georges to masquerade as the happy husband of
    Jean-Michael&#146;s natural mother who is to be Albin in drag. Ironically, the overall
    theme of the musical, pointed out by both Steve Graver and Dr. Hall is family values, this
    being evident with the great lengths the father goes to accommodate his son. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">As the story ends, everyone accepts and discovers the truth without
    prejudice. The end is the entire Dindon family being sneaked out of the cabaret to avoid
    embarrassment of the conservative father. This is sure to be an entertaining and
    enlightening show. </font></td>
