        <td><font size="4">Almost two weeks ago, a group of
        students from St. Mary&#146;s College in Maryland, were
        on their way back from an excursion in the northern
        Guatemalan province of Peten where they had been viewing
        ancient Mayan ruins. After three weeks in the tiny
        Central American nation, this was their last day. At 4
        p.m. on that afternoon while the group was traveling
        along Guatemala&#146;s Pacific highway near the southern
        town of Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa, 40 miles Southwest of
        Guatemala City, their bus was forced off the road by a
        pick-up truck and the thirteen member group was forced
        out of the vehicle at gun point.</font><p><font size="4">The
        group made up of thirteen college students and three
        school officials were attacked and robbed. The five women
        in the group, all between the ages of 18 and 20, were
        raped by the bandits. The entire incident took 90
        minutes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">``It was four armed men in a pick-up
        truck. They raped five women,&#146;&#146; said Frank
        Neville, U.S. embassy spokesman. He also said police have
        arrested two Guatemalan men suspected of taking part in
        the attack and that the officials in Guatemala are
        continuing the search for the other bandits. However, the
        figure of four men was later increased to seven men.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The attack hit the campus of St.
        Mary&#146;s College hard. Most were shocked and outraged
        that this could happen. The study tour was the
        college&#146;s third to Guatemala. College officials said
        the two previous trips were without incident. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">President Clinton, spoke to a group of
        high school students on Monday. ``It&#146;s a terrible
        thing, what happened, and I have a lot of concerns,
        obviously, for the victims and their families. But
        we&#146;re persuaded the government is taking appropriate
        action,&#146;&#146; Clinton told reporters.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">One of the major industries in
        Guatemala is tourism. Fearful of what the story could do
        to its economy, Guatemala&#146;s ambassador to the United
        States drove to St. Mary&#146;s College just outside of
        Washington DC to express his sorrow and regret to
        students and faculty at the College. ``At this time we
        are going to concentrate all our efforts in assisting in
        the healing of the victims in as many ways as
        possible,&#146;&#146; Ambassador Pedro Lamport told
        reporters at the college in St. Mary&#146;s City,
        Maryland. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">As the week went on, five suspects were
        arrested and jailed. All five are now awaiting trial, but
        the other two suspects are still on the loose. In light
        of this situation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
        was called upon by the Guatemalan government to assist in
        their investigation of the crimes. ``The request was made
        by the Guatemalan authorities for assistance, and some
        assistance is being provided,&#146;&#146; spokesman James
        Rubin said. A State Department official said the help the
        FBI provided would ``most likely take the form of some
        forensic evidence support, either on the ground there or
        evidence could be transported to a different
        location.&#146;&#146; He went on to say that, ``It&#146;s
        not the first time we&#146;ve done this sort of thing
        there or in other countries.&#146;&#146;</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Violent attacks and robberies against
        tourists are not uncommon in Guatemala. The U.S. State
        Department warns visitors going to Guatemala about
        highway robbery and armed assaults. </font></p>
