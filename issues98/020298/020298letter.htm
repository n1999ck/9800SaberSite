    <td><font size="4">I attended a forum recently on diversity. As one speaker pointed out,
    no one there was kidding themselves about the true topic at hand: blacks and whites. There
    were only occasional references to Latinos and Asians, a few about women, persons with
    disabilities and other minority groups. This was probably for the best since just
    discussing the issues of blacks and whites has been enough to keep us busy for the past
    four decades. </font><p><font size="4">The four person panel who spoke individually on the
    topic were informative and interesting, however, there was little discussed when the floor
    was opened to comments that I had not heard on Oprah many times.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">Everyone who spoke seemed genuine. One of the problems in this country
    is most of us are quick to speak of loving all people <!--webbot bot="ImageMap" rectangle="(16,271) (230,291) mailto:saber@colstate.edu" src="020298readerpoll.jpg" align="right" border="0" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="250" height="300" startspan --><MAP NAME="FrontPageMap"><AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="16, 271, 230, 291" HREF="mailto:saber@colstate.edu"></MAP><a href="../../../_vti_bin/shtml.dll/Old_saber_site/issues98/020298/020298letter.htm/map"><img src="020298readerpoll.jpg" align="right" border="0" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="250" height="300" ismap usemap="#FrontPageMap"></a><!--webbot bot="ImageMap" endspan i-checksum="46177" -->regardless of
    skin color, but few of us are as quick to put much more on the line for our beliefs. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">Many people at the forum compared people to rainbows, saying that
    rainbows are beautiful and so is the same diversity in people. This is true, but
    haven&#146;t we heard it before?</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">One man stood to say that 30 years ago he attended forums at Columbus
    College to discuss the same topic and that people are still saying the same things. This
    should tell us something.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">One would be hard pressed to find a person, black or white who would
    stand up and say that another race is inferior or inherently evil. Cross burnings are not
    an every day occurrence in Columbus. However, are the problems among the races over? </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">People are not using the word &#147;nigger&#148; as often as they once
    did. But some white people commonly whisper the word &#147;black&#148; as if it is an
    affliction. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">One young black man during the forum said a friend of his told him he
    was &#147;white/black&#148;, a comment that was meant to be taken as a compliment. Many
    people in the audience groaned, both black and white, because these sort of comments are
    the common problem we are dealing with today. The woman who made the comment didn&#146;t
    have to use the word &#147;nigger&#148; to make the point that people of different races
    are ignorant of one another.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">It staggers me and saddens me that 30 years after the death of Martin
    Luther King, Jr., it is still necessary to hold discussions on a university campus about
    blacks and whites not eating together. Even though the obvious face of racism is
    diminishing, it seems the more subtle face is still here. There is no sign over the water
    fountain which reads, &#147;whites only&#148;, but less visible problems are real. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">Racism today is a subtle battle. It is a battle between people who still
    feel the pain of oppression and people who feel blamed for crimes committed before their
    birth. It is a fight between those who feel feared and those who feel fear. As one person
    in the forum pointed out, it is battle not fought with swords, but with pens. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">While many whites would never use the word nigger, they would not want
    their own daughter to marry outside of her race. Many blacks deal with being told by peers
    that they are &#147;too white&#148; or &#147;sell outs&#148; because they associate with
    white people. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">So much of what we say and do today in race relations is a matter of
    political correctness, politeness or current trend and not about real understanding of the
    another culture. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">We can continue to make colorful analogies comparing race to rainbows
    and repeating that we should all see people for who they are on the inside. While these
    cliches may be true, we should be past this first step by now. We should be past
    identifying and recognizing the problem and on to doing something about it.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">As a woman, I must look ahead to making 75 cents on the dollar to the
    male peers that graduate along side me. People can tell me how far women have come,
    elderly women can share stories of inequalities in the past, we can attend round table
    discussions about it, but in the end I still want my 25 cents. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">We have decided to call each other equals, we speak about loving one,
    but we still lack action. If our ideals were as high as we claim, we would have reached
    farther by now.</font></td>
