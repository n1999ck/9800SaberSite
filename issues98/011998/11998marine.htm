<p><font size="4">December 1997 was exciting for 11 Biology and
Pre-med majors and faculty members of the Biology Department, who
attended Course number BIO495 in Florida. The short, high
intensity intersession course in tropical marine biology was
initiated in 1990 by Dr. William Birkhead and Dr. Glenn Stokes
and offered by the CSU Biology Department in the CSU course
catalogue. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The course allows students to study the
ecosystems of Florida first hand. The marine biology intersession
course entailed a six-day trip to Florida, December 6-11, to
explore, see and hear about various ecosystems and to visit three
marine institutes and research centers. The students got full
credit for this course. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">After financial help from the Student
Government Fund for Student Academic Activities the cost was
$220,- per student. This does not include the regular course
registration fees.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><img src="11998Marine.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="400" height="282"></font><font size="4">The students had to rough it a little and put in a good
deal of work and effort. Each student had to prepare a seminar
about a certain community and present it during the trip right
before the group would saw the actual community.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Seminars conducted during the trip concerned
subjects such as the Everglades sawgrass community, island
formation, cypress swamp, coral reef communities, turtle grass
marine community, hardwood hammock community, mangrove community,
hard- and soft-bottom marine communities, algae community and
beach community. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Reports from some of the students and faculty
members who participated were brimming with excitement about an
incredible, unforgettable experience. Also, there were comments
about hard work, swimming in cold water at 8:30 in the morning
and roughing in on the floor for a good night&#146;s sleep.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The group left Columbus, GA on December 6,
heading for Naples, Florida to spend the night at a environmental
learning center on the floor of the lab. December 7th started
with a trip to Corkscrew Swamp where the students got a chance to
look around a Cyprus swamp and experience the different
communities inhabiting it. They traveled on through the
Everglades looking at a sawgrass marsh and then continued on to
Marathon Key, just north of Key West to spend the night. The next
day, December 8, they traveled on to Big Pine Key. There, the
students toured the Harbor Branch Marine Institute, a high-tech
oceanographic research center. Their day ended at the Newfound
Harbor Marine Institute on Big Pine Key where they would stay for
the next three days, observing the flora and fauna present in the
area, exploring the mangrove trees and tidal communities, as well
as doing some snorkeling to observe coral reef communities. Oh,
and let&#146;s not forget about the night time trip to Key West
to experience first hand the various nightlife communities
there... </font></p>

<p><font size="4">On December 10th the group started on their way
back home. They stopped to spend the night at Fort Pierce, just
below Cape Canaveral, at the Johnson &amp; Johnson Deep Sea
Facility where the group had the opportunity to tour the facility
and look at various submersible deep sea exploration equipment.
They arrived back in Columbus on December 11. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The participating students were Joan Bingham,
Jana Chalkley, Shannon Cotton, Thomas Hunter, Matt Martin, Tom
McCoy, Dianne O&#146;Shea, Marcie Parrish, Elizabeth Sikes,
Dorana Vasquez-Hernandez, and Tarish Fields. Faculty escorting
the group were Drs. Bill Birkhead, Glenn Stokes, Julie Ballenger,
and George Stanton.<br>
Other courses such as this one to visit the Bahamas, Haiti and
Panama, for hands-on experience are currently in the planning
stages and the territories are being explored for their
eco-systems by Dr. Julie Ballenger and Dr. Birkhead.</font></p>
