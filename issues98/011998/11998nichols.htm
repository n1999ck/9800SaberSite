<p><font size="4">The Terry Nichols trial was expected to be very
similar to the Timothy McVeigh trial. The trials were both
expected to end with the defendants receiving the death <img src="11998terry.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="138" height="197"></font><font size="4">penalty.
Expectations were not met. This trial had a surprise ending. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">It seems as though the two trials began to
differ just before Christmas, when the five man, seven woman jury
found Terry Nichols not guilty of carrying out the act of bombing
the Oklahoma Murrah Federal Building on April 19, 1995. However,
the jury did find him guilty of manslaughter for conspiring to
carry out the bombing. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The jury went into deliberations with the split
decision of guilty and not guilty, and were faced with the task
of deciding the fate of Terry Nichols. After hours of
deliberations, the decision was turned over to Judge Richard
Matsch, because the jury had reached a standstill and was
declared deadlocked. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The penalty decision is now up to Judge Matsch,
but he cannot impose the death penalty. Federal sentencing guides
dictate that the death penalty can only be given by a jury.
Regardless of Judge Matsch's decision, prosecutors have promised
to press charges against Nichols that carry the death penalty. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">This decision, so far, has been an extremely
unpopular one. The jury forewoman and nurse, Niki Deutchman, has
received bomb threats at her home on three separate occasions
since the jury failed to come to a decision. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Deutchman told the press, &quot;There are some
families of the victims that are enough upset that we've heard
from them in some rather significant ways. We've been advised not
to do any more media.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The families of the victims are not the only
people unhappy with the way things are going in this trial. Terry
Nichols' mother, Joyce Wilt, told local Oklahoma newspapers that
the death penalty would have been better than what her son will
now face. &quot;My gosh, with him suffering, you know, what's his
life going to be? Nothing. He has no future. Death would have
been easier than him being put in there, he's being tortured for
something he did not do, &quot;she told The Oklahoma. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">During court battles, prosecutors Pat Ryan and
Beth Wilkinson both questioned the thinking behind Nichols'
actions. Wilkinson asked the jury, &quot;What in the world did he
think the bomb would do to the people in that building?&quot;
Defense lawyer, Michael Tigar, often responded by asking the jury
to not let the prosecution persuade them to anger and vengeance,
reminding them that justice is what was being sought. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Timothy McVeigh is scheduled to die on June 13,
and in all likelihood, Terry Nichols will still be in court. </font></p>
