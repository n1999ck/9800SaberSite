<p><font size="4">Over the summer, Anna Mion, a History Major and
Junior at Columbus State University, participated in a six week
study abroad program in Metz, France. She was awarded the Board
of Regents Study Abroad Scholarship to take classes in Art
History, Business,and Modern French History. These classes were
all taught by Georgia teachers to Georgia students. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Anna was born in Columbus and attended Hardaway
High School before coming to Columbus State. Her father, Dr.
Mario Mion, Chair of Political Science, stated that, &quot;I <img src="11998AnnaMion.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="350" height="256"></font><font size="4">wish more people
from this University would apply for these scholarships.&quot;
The Board of Regents handed out 100 scholarships last year, and
are hoping to double that number this year. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">While in France, Anna and her classmates made
several field trips to nearby cities, including a medieval
cathedral in Nancy. Anna stated, &quot;The experience of visiting
a cathedral, and having a class on it right outside of it is
amazing.&quot; In addition to the trip to Nancy, Anna also
visited the World War One fortifications around Verdun, France
and visited the Maginot Line that separated France from Germany
in World War II. She says, &quot;The country is the classroom.
That's what makes it so exciting.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">On the weekends, she was able to take trips to
other parts of France, and also to visit her relatives in
Northern Italy. Anna is applying again this year for the Study
Abroad scholarship and wants to go back to France, this time to
study the French language. She said, &quot;I found the majority
of French people to be nice. If you try and speak their language,
most of them will work with you. There are some rude people, but
you run into rude people in every country.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="4">Upon her graduation, Anna is considering a
career in Law or Teaching.</font> </p>
