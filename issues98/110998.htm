        <hr>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial">Thirteen faculty members
        from various institutions in Georgia traveled to
        Singapore and Malaysia this past summer. The trip was
        made possible by the prestigious Fulbright-Hays Grant
        which matches $45,000 and allowed these thirteen faculty
        to study and travel in Singapore and Malaysia for 4
        weeks. The grant is the fifth Fulbright Grant Columbus
        State University has received from the United States
        Department of Education.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial">The purpose of the faculty
        development program is to promote mutual understanding
        between people of the United States and other countries
        through educational and cultural exchange. The program is
        organized by the National University of Singapore,
        University Putra Malaysia, Columbus State University and
        the Nine University and College International Studies
        Consortium of Georgia. The 13 members participating in
        the program consisted of social science and humanities
        professors from universities and colleges in Georgia.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial">Rajgopal Sashti, Director
        of the Nine University and College International Studies
        Consortium of Georgia, was able to explain the main
        reason for having the program in this portion of the
        region. &#147;Singapore and Malaysia are located in one
        of the most strategic trade routes of the world between
        east and west&#148;, says Sashti. He explains, &#147;both
        are relatively small countries and although many in the
        United States know about Singapore as a result of the
        Michael Faye incident in 1994, today the relationship
        between the U.S. and Singapore is at its best.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial">Mr. Sashti was able to
        tell me the significance of the two countries and gave me
        some insight regarding Singapore and Malaysia as well. He
        mentioned that Singapore is a small country with the
        world&#146;s second most competitive economy. Its economy
        is very successful with a per capita of $26,000 a year.
        Singapore is described by Sashti as being &#147;a
        gleaming, modern, western-looking city built out of
        nothing.&#148; For such a small city, Singapore contains
        the third largest oil refining country in the world and
        boasts a superior education system.
        &#147;Singapore&#146;s economy is strong and solid,&#148;
        says Sashti.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial">Malaysia was also explored
        during the trip and contained very interesting aspects
        for the participants. Apart from Singapore, Malaysia
        maintains global interdependence containing both money
        and a wealthy economy. The government encourages
        religious and cultural harmony with Islam being the
        straight religion of the country. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial">Singapore and Malaysia
        have become separated, but Malaysia has become a
        successful country. According to Sashti, the trip was
        very successful and educational in part due to the
        seminars, conferences, and field trips which the
        participants attended. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial">Sashti states,
        &#147;Columbus State University has emerged as a leader
        in training and development among the 34 colleges and
        universities within the University System of
        Georgia.&#148;</font></p>
