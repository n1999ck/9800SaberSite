        have a question for all of you that eat in the cafeteria
        on a regular basis- have you ever eaten in the Oxford
        Room? For those of you who don&#146;t know where to find
        this room, it&#146;s of to the side of the main dining
        area; a dimly lit room, with books along the walls to
        give it that scholarly, intellectual feel. Now that you
        know what I&#146;m referring to, I&#146;d like to ask the
        question again- have you ever eaten there? Well, if you
        are not a music major then I doubt not. It seems that
        each year (or at least the years I&#146;ve been here)
        that the Oxford Room has been designated for this small,
        select few. There is no sign on the door stating that it
        is off limits to &#147;other people&#148;, but take one
        step through the door and, if you are not a part of their
        &#147;group&#148;, then you will not feel welcome. As the
        old saying goes, &#147;Actions speak louder than words&#148;
        and the actions of these students are as cold to
        outsiders as a piece of ice to the skin. It is said that
        music speaks in all languages- perhaps one day these
        people will learn to speak the language of kindness and
        offer a friendly hello to all those that enter their
        domain. </strong></font></p>
