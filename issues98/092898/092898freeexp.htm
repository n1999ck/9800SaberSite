        <td><font size="4"><strong>Do you remember those Saturday
        morning commercials where Bugs Bunny, Yosemite Sam, and
        Porky Pig proclaimed, &#147;The Constitution works for
        kids, too!&#148;? Well, the Constitution works for
        college students too, even though it often gets lost in
        bureaucratic red tape and public relations. We don&#146;t
        have to check our rights, especially our freedom of
        expression, at the door when we come to CSU. Our First
        Amendment freedoms of speech and press allow people with
        good ideas to speak out and change things for the better.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Freedom of expression has its roots in
        17th century England and America, when John Milton and
        Roger Williams argued for freedom of religion and
        unlicensed printing. Over two hundred years ago, our
        founding fathers felt that the freedoms of speech and
        press were essential for a successful democracy. They
        believed in the &#147;Market Place of Ideas,&#148; a
        notion that people should be allowed to express their
        ideas so that the public can choose the best ones to put
        into action. Free speech does have limits; for example,
        defamation and conspiracy to commit a crime are
        unprotected forms of speech. In 1798, the Alien and
        Sedition Acts were passed to end criticism of the
        Federalist party, which controlled the government at that
        time. A number of newspaper editors and publishers were
        prosecuted under these acts for printing negative
        opinions about the government. The acts were later
        repealed because legitimate opinions have a right to be
        heard, even if they are negative.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The historical connotation of
        &#147;press&#148; includes every sort of publication that
        is a vehicle for information and opinion. Walter Lippman
        said that &#147;A free press is not a privilege but an
        organic necessity in a great society,&#148; and French
        philosopher Albert Camus wrote, &#147;A free press can of
        course be good or bad, but most certainly, without
        freedom it will never be anything but bad ... Freedom is
        nothing else but a chance to be better&#148; (italics
        mine). Freedom of expression in the press insures the
        introduction of new ideas into organizations, government,
        and society.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>In the Supreme Court case
        Rosenberger v. University of Virginia, the court defended
        freedom of speech and press. A student organization was
        denied funding for its newspaper because of its Christian
        perspective. The university claimed that funding a
        religious group would violate the Establishment clause,
        which forbids laws respecting any establishment of
        religion. The organization took the matter to court,
        claiming that the university had violated its freedom of
        speech and press. The Supreme Court said that the
        government (or any state entity) must abstain from
        regulating speech when the viewpoint or opinion of the
        speaker is the primary rationale for the restriction. For
        the university to disapprove of particular viewpoints
        risks the suppression of free speech and creative inquiry
        in one of the nation&#146;s vital centers of intellectual
        life, its colleges and universities.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>One Supreme Court Justice
        wrote, &#147;Freedom to speak and write about public
        questions is as important to the life of our government
        as the heart is to the human body. In fact, this
        privilege is the heart of our government! If that heart
        be weakened, the result is debilitation; if it be
        stilled, the result is death.&#148; These freedoms are
        not only the heart of the government, they are the heart
        of every organization. As the world changes,
        organizations must adapt, but without new ideas, change
        is impossible. Freedom of speech and press gives us the
        right to express our legitimate ideas and opinions
        without censorship from the government, or ideally, from
        any other authority. We have an outlet for these freedoms
        here at CSU: The Saber. If you have an opinion about
        something that needs to be changed, or a new idea, write
        to the Saber. Letters and articles can be placed in the
        Saber mailbox, which is located outside the SGA office in
        the Davidson Student Center. Remember, even the best
        ideas will not work if they are never expressed. We
        encourage you to exercise your freedoms of speech and
        press to make CSU a better place!</strong></font></p>
