        <td><font size="4"><strong>The Career Center in Davidson
        Student Center is on a mission. Concerned because
        students express surprise that the office is a one-stop
        smorgasbord of career-related information and assistance,
        the staff is redoubling its efforts to get information
        out to students.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>One
        unique way of communication is the &#147;Toilet
        Tribune,&#148; a colorful flyer posted in strategic spots
        in the restroom facilities throughout campus. The first
        issue for fall semester is in an eye-catching shade of
        green. It is chock full of interesting bits of
        information about programs from the Career Center as well
        as some eye-opening facts and figures about starting
        salaries for various majors. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Christi Dixon of the Career
        Center says they plan to publish two tribunes each
        semester. The second issue will be coming to a stall near
        you around mid-term. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Two upcoming events highlighted
        in the current Toilet Tribune are Etiquette Day and Super
        Saturday.</strong></font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="5"><strong>Etiquette Day</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>CSU&#146;s annual Etiquette Day
        is scheduled for Saturday, October 3, in Davidson Student
        Center. Fifty lucky participants will receive an in depth
        introduction to the business world through the eyes of
        one of the foremost experts in corporate etiquette. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Peggy Newfield has presented
        this seminar on campus for several years. From Atlanta,
        she is president of Personal Best, a communication skills
        consulting firm that specializes in seminars focusing on
        social protocol for the corporate world. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The day-long, 9 a.m.-4 p.m.,
        seminar costs $15 which includes a full, five-course
        luncheon, as well as focusing on professional dress,
        business etiquette and networking to advantage. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dixon urges juniors and seniors
        in particular to sign up for this important seminar
        because &#147;today&#146;s corporate hiring is being done
        more and more in a social context, such as cocktail
        parties or over executive lunches.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="5"><strong>Super Saturday</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Saturday, October 17 is Super
        Saturday at CSU. The kickoff for the 1998-99 Cougar
        P.A.W.S., Super Saturday is an effort to involve students
        in community activities. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Following breakfast at 7:30,
        participants select from three areas of involvement:
        Habitat, Keep Columbus Beautiful (Help the Hooch), or the
        Exchange Club&#146;s picnic for Big Brothers, Big
        Sisters. Registration is $5 per person and includes
        breakfast and a T-shirt. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dixon points out that there is
        no requirement for commitment beyond this day, although
        the goal is to get students involved in the community. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>An added incentive for
        continued participation is the certificate program. Using
        color-coded seals to denote different levels of
        participation, the certificate gives participating
        students a nice wall plaque that commemorates their civic
        involvement.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The Center has started a mail
        campaign to all students and recent alumni. The letter
        discusses some of the career-related services available
        and includes an introduction to the Center&#146;s
        website. A brief tour of their internet address,
        &lt;www.colstate.edu/student/career&gt;, connects to many
        of the Center&#146;s services. Students and recent alumni
        can prepare resumes for entry in the resume data bank
        right on line. Just follow the prompts.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The Career Center and its staff
        exist to assist students and alumni. Stop by and get to
        know them&#151;take advantage of all they have to offer.</strong></font></p>
