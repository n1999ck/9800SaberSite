        <td><font size="4"><strong>Students come to college
        expecting this great place where they can obtain a great
        education and have fun at the same time. However,
        students learn quickly that having fun is not as easy as
        it seems. I have been approached by several students who
        seem to have a hard time with the amount of attractions
        in Columbus. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>There
        always seems to be a problem. Either the person is not of
        age to attend a particular place or there is no place to
        really go which attracts young people.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Recently, the main attractions
        around Columbus have been cracking down by making the
        premier audience 21 years of age and above. I realize the
        problems and risks of underage drinking, but the primary
        audience is freshmen and sophomores. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Columbus State University has
        begun to bring more student activities onto campus as it
        becomes covered with younger students. The Greek
        organizations are expanding as well due to the recent
        acquisition of fraternity houses near the campus of CSU.
        Small things such as these allow students to have fun on
        campus, but what is there to do off campus which is
        directed toward the crowd under the age of twenty-one? </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Columbus needs to acquire a few
        new places in the area that caters to the younger
        atmosphere. This will benefit students tremendously by
        allowing them to stay close to home instead of traveling
        to Auburn or Atlanta. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>As Columbus State University
        becomes a younger more traditional campus in the future,
        the city of Columbus needs to think of things for the
        younger crowd to do in town. This will allow students to
        have fun in a great environment which is most importantly
        close to home. </strong></font></p>
