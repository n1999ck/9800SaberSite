        attended Columbus State University directly out of high

        was the friendly environment the campus contained and the
        outstanding student to teacher ratio,&#148; Monteith
        stated.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Tricia is currently a junior
        with a double major, pursuing both Respiratory Therapy
        and Health Science. Tricia hopes to work as either a
        respiratory therapist or in health education following
        graduation. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Her success stretches beyond
        her academics as a result of her involvement in the
        Columbus State University C.O.R.E. and as a student
        assistant in the Admissions Office on campus. </strong></font></p>
