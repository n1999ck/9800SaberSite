        <td><font size="4"><strong>Are you ready for some
        football? Although the weather may not indicate it, fall
        is here. Now is the time when the leaves begin changing
        and the weekends are filled with non-stop football
        coverage. It is also a time when some teams surpass their
        goals and some remain in the doldrums. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>The Atlanta Falcons fit well into this
        category. After a tough season last year, they look to
        rebound and actually be a contender. However, this is
        dependent on the health of quarterback Chris Chandler,
        who was constantly injured. They finished the season at
        7-9 and lost six of those games when he was out. Dan
        Reeves has made some changes in the offensive line for
        better protection, but only time will tell. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>On a local level how about the
        Auburn Tigers? Well, let&#146;s just say last year was a
        great year. Dameyune Craig is gone, two starters have
        quit the team, and one player has been arrested. Terry
        Bowden will be happy for some good news, and it likely
        will not occur. They play LSU, Tennessee, and travel to
        Mississippi State and Florida. Without a proven
        quarterback, the tigers return to a ground attack and
        hope for better success. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Across the state Alabama looks
        to improve, but won&#146;t contend for the SEC
        championship. The tide does return a starting running
        back, and a good corner back in Fernando Bryant, but the
        rest remains a big question mark. In order for the tide
        to be successful, many of the younger players must step
        up, and the quarterback must learn to throw. Despite the
        past success of running the ball, head coach Mike Dubose
        is determined to air it out.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Closer to home, Georgia should
        remain tough but will struggle to have the success that
        it did last year. The running game remains strong with
        Patrick Pass, Olandis Gary, and the addition of Columbus
        native Jasper Sanks. However, the quarterback position
        remains a question mark and will be a highly contested
        battle. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Georgia Tech has the best
        chance out of all the area colleges to have a very
        successful year. Despite the loss of key linebackers, the
        defense remains strong and Joe Hamilton returns at
        quarterback. The only weakness may be the receivers
        because they do not have a lot of experience, but the
        talent is there. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Let the season begin and
        we&#146;ll see what happens. </strong></font></p>
