        <td><font size="4"><strong>Did you know that every day,
        33,000 Americans get a STD? More than 12 million
        Americans get a STD each year. And, at least one in four
        Americans will have a STD at some time in their lives.
        There are more than 20 STDs out there. Of these, Genital
        Herpes affects more than 55 million Americans.
        Approximately 1/4 of all Americans over the age of 15
        have genital herpes. The worst part is that 1/2 of all
        people infected with genital herpes do not even know it.
        The purpose of this article is to point out some common
        misinformation regarding this disease as well as the ease
        in acquiring it. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>First
        of all, herpes is a problem for all who have ever been
        sexually active or plan to become sexually active (hmmm,
        could this mean you?). Yes, you! Herpes is not a disease
        that affects only the promiscuous or the individual who
        has had numerous sexual partners. A person can catch
        herpes even if one has only had sexual relations with one
        person and even if that person is your husband or wife!</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>So what are the classic
        symptoms of genital herpes? The symptoms vary in severity
        and type, from person to person, and from outbreak to
        outbreak. Herpes is one of those sexually transmitted
        diseases that does not follow any particular set of
        rules. The classic symptoms can include blister like
        sores on the genital areas as well as the upper thighs
        and rectal region, a red patch of skin, a tiny sore, an
        irritation around the anus, itching and burning of the
        genital areas, and pain during urination. Genital herpes
        can also result in swollen glands, fatigue and headache. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>But I know what you&#146;re
        saying to yourself right now. &#147;Herpes happens to
        other people. I&#146;m not going to get herpes.&#148;
        Don&#146;t kid yourself people. Remember, 1/2 of the
        people infected with herpes do not know they are
        infected.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Myth: You cannot get herpes if
        you always use a condom during sexual intercourse.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Fact: Using condoms does NOT
        provide 100% guarantee of protection from genital herpes.
        Abstinence is the only way to 100% guarantee your
        protection. But if you use condoms, realize that they may
        not cover all sites of exposure. Herpes can be present on
        the male&#146;s scrotum or in the female&#146;s vaginal
        secretions, which could reach skin not covered by
        condoms. Herpes infection can also exist on the upper
        thighs or rectal areas of either the man or woman.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Myth: Someone with herpes has
        noticeable sores or blemishes on his/her genitalia so if
        there is no visual evidence of herpes on my partner, then
        I can feel safe that he or she does not have herpes. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Fact: Herpes can be very
        subtle. It can go unnoticed for weeks, months, and even
        YEARS! As a result, herpes is often unknowingly and
        accidentally spread to a sexual partner. A person can
        acquire herpes without recognizing the first episode or
        even subsequent episodes because some of the milder
        symptoms resemble yeast infections, ingrown hair, heat
        bumps, bladder infections, the flu and hemorrhoids. Also,
        some people with herpes are symptom free all or most of
        their lives. But just because one shows no symptoms does
        not mean there is no herpes infection present. A person
        with herpes is contagious even when no outward symptoms
        are visible. Therein lies the danger of widespread
        transmission. To restate, 1/2 of all people infected with
        herpes do not know they are infected. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Finally, if one suspects he/she
        might have herpes, it is important to be seen by a
        physician or nurse practitioner and be tested. There is
        no cure for herpes. There are effective treatments and
        medications however. Herpes is not a death sentence.
        Herpes is an unfortunate fact of life for many more
        people than one might imagine. Herpes may be a part of
        your life or your future life. Know the facts. Protect
        yourself and your partner(s). Get tested. And be careful
        out there.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Resources: There are a number
        of organizations who provide confidential telephone
        counseling. There are also many web pages on the internet
        where one can find out more. Last, but certainly not
        least, the Student Health Clinic is available to students
        for information and testing.</strong></font></p>
