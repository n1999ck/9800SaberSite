        was very successful with only men&#146;s and women&#146;s
        cross-country not going to post season competition. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>The men&#146;s basketball team finished
        the season with 26 wins and lost in the first round of
        the Division II playoffs to arch rival USC Aiken. Larry
        Coates was named to the the second team all-american. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The women were undefeated in
        regular season and lost to Francis Marion in the second
        round of the Division II playoffs. They finished the
        season with record of 22 and 4, their best ever. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Baseball was in transition
        under first year coach Larry Appleton, but the team
        finished strong with a trip to the playoffs. They
        defeated Georgia College and lost to #1 Kennesaw State.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The Lady Cougar softball team
        finished with a record of 18 and 2. They defeated #1
        Kennesaw State before losing in the rematch. Julie Garcia
        was named to the first team all-america and now plays for
        the Virginia Roadsters of the Women&#146;s Profession
        Fastpitch League. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Both the men and women tennis
        teams were ranked in the top 25. The women defeated
        Mississippi University for Women 5-0 and lost to Georgia
        College and State University in the following match of
        the Division II playoffs. The men finished the season
        with a 5-4 loss to the University of West Florida in the
        first round of playoffs. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The golf team had all the
        talent to repeat as national champs but came up short
        with a second place finish. Florida Southern made their
        move on the second day of competition and never looked
        back. John Drewery was named the Peach Belt player of the
        year.</strong></font></p>
