        have experienced and all we have seen, nothing can
        prepare us for the wonders of what lies beyond.&#148;
        That is a quote from a website devoted to the movie
        &#147;What Dreams May Come.&#148;</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong><img src="083198dreams.jpg" align="right" hspace="0" width="220" height="110"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>Academy Award Winner Robin
        Williams&#146; next movie is going to take you on an
        amazing journey...through heaven and hell to rediscover
        the meaning of life and to find out what exactly love is.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Williams is joined by
        Oscar-winner Cuba Gooding, Jr., Annabella Sciorra, and
        Max Von Sydow. The movie is directed by Vincent Ward, and
        the screenplay done by Ron Bass. &#147;What Dreams May
        Come&#148; is based upon the book by Richard Matheson.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;What Dreams May
        Come&#148; is a very different type of love story. It
        starts out with Williams&#146; character, Chris, dying.
        Once he has realized and accepted the fact that he has
        died, he must deal with the issue of being separated from
        his wife, Annie. If the movie follows the same path as
        the book, then this is going to be an incredible movie. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The budget for the project
        reached nearly $100 million. The official website has
        opened and the images are amazing. When you run through,
        scroll your mouse over each picture entirely because
        things are hidden everywhere. If you want to check out

        <p><font size="4"><strong>Look for the movie to be
        released before or on Christmas.</strong></font></p>
