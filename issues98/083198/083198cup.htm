        <td><font size="4"><strong>&gt;&gt; United States falters</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>The World Cup of &#145;98 was supposed
        to be a successful one for the United States. However it
        turned out to be a disaster. The U.S. lost all three of
        their games and forced the resignation of coach Steve
        Sampson. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Gearing up for the competition
        the team defeated Brazil, who at the time was ranked #1
        in the world, but struggled with lesser known teams.
        Another blow came when John Harkes, who was captain of
        the &#145;94 team was left off the roster. The troubles
        continued as they suffered a 2-0 loss at the hands of the
        Germans in the opening game. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Many players were upset at not
        getting adequate playing time throughout the tournament.
        Eric Wynalda, who started the majority of the games in
        the previous World Cup, saw only limited action against
        Yugoslavia, Alexi Lalas sat on the bench the entire
        tournament, and Marcela Balboa only played a few minutes
        in the final match.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>So now upset and defeated the
        U.S. looks for a new coach and better opportunities. The
        selection has centered around Bora Militinovich, coach of
        Nigeria, and Bruce Arena who coaches D.C. United. The
        decision should be fairly soon and maybe 2002 World Cup
        will be better. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&gt;&gt; France wins</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Imagine the Atlanta Falcons
        winning the Superbowl, well France did just that except
        in soccer this past summer. They defeated the reigning
        world champions Brazil 3-0 in the final match.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>This feat has only been
        accomplished three previous times by the host country,
        and this one was possibly the biggest upset ever. Brazil
        boasts many of the top players in the world, and they
        play for the top professional teams around the globe.
        However, on July 12th none of that mattered as France
        controlled the entire game. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>After the victory, fans flowed
        into the streets and celebrated until the early morning
        hours. Many people, as well as the French press, did not
        give the team any chance, but they were proven wrong. </strong></font></p>
