        Aerosmith is about to kick off their fall tour on
        September 9 in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The band has
        announced plans to release a new live album, its first
        live project since 1988&#146;s &#147;Classics Live
        2,&#148; on October 20. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;A
        Little South of Sanity,&#148; features 23 songs taken
        from the 1993-94 world tour in support of &#147;Get a
        Grip&#148; and several tracks from the current &#147;Nine
        Lives&#148; tour. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The track listing for &#147;A
        Little South of Sanity&#148; is as follows: &#147;Eat the
        Rich,&#148; &#147;Love in an Elevator,&#148;
        &#147;Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees),&#148;
        &#147;Same Old Song and Dance,&#148; &#147;Hole in My
        Soul,&#148; &#147;Monkey on My Back,&#148;
        &#147;Livin&#146; on the Edge,&#148;
        &#147;Cryin&#146;,&#148; &#147;Rag Doll,&#148;
        &#147;Angel,&#148; &#147;Janie&#146;s Got a Gun,&#148;
        &#147;Amazing,&#148; &#147;Back in the Saddle,&#148;

        &#147;Walk on Down,&#148; &#147;Dream On,&#148;
        &#147;Crazy,&#148; &#147;Mama Kin,&#148; &#147;Walk this
        Way,&#148; &#147;Dude (Looks Like a Lady),&#148;
        &#147;What It Takes,&#148; and &#147;Sweet Emotion.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&gt;&gt; Frontman for the band
        Days of the New, Travis Meeks, is acting up again.
        Actually, he is acting more like a child than he is a
        band leader. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Meeks has been telling fans and
        friends that he plans on continuing on without the help
        of the other players in the band. The record company has
        denied the reports, saying that, &#147;Travis just
        talks.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>According to their official
        website last month, Days of the New were going to be
        making an announcement last week concerning their future.
        That announcement never happened. What did happen is that
        a message was posted that said, &#147;Hey everybody...
        We&#146;re one big #!@$%# happy family!!!&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Meeks appeared on a message
        board online recently and posted a message apologizing
        for &#147;giving people the impression that Days of the
        New was a band.&#148; He continued, &#147;It wasn&#146;t
        truly a band format, it is my fault for leading you on
        and setting you up to get attached to the prior
        members.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Meeks tells his fans that he is
        going to play all the instruments himself and that only
        one other band member appears on the album, which is due
        out early next year. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I think the other band members,
        the record label, and the few fans they have acquired
        only by being an opening act for Metallica have waisted
        way too much time on this spoiled brat.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&gt;&gt; Speaking of brats,
        Oasis is putting the finishing strokes on a new album,
        &#147;The Masterplan.&#148; It is a collection of B-sides
        that have appeared on the group&#146;s U.K. singles. The
        follow up release to their excellent 1997 album, &#147;Be
        Here Now,&#148; is due out in November. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The track listing for &#147;The
        Masterplan&#148; is as follows: &#147;Acquiesce&#148; -
        from &#147;Some Might Say&#148; single, &#147;Underneath
        the Sky&#148; - from &#147;Don&#146;t Look Back in
        Anger&#148; single, &#147;Talk Tonight&#148; - from
        &#147;Some Might Say&#148; single, &#147;Going
        Nowhere&#148; - from &#147;Stand By Me&#148; single,
        &#147;Fade Away&#148; - from &#147;Cigarettes &amp;
        Alcohol&#148; single ,&#148;The Swamp Song&#148; - from
        &#147;Wonderwall&#148; single, &#147;I Am the
        Walrus&#148; - from &#147;Cigarettes &amp; Alcohol&#148;
        single, &#147;Listen Up&#148; - from &#147;Cigarettes
        &amp; Alcohol&#148; single, &#147;Rockin&#146;
        Chair&#148; - from &#147;Roll With It&#148; single,
        &#147;Half the World Away&#148; - from
        &#147;Whatever&#148; single,&#148;(It&#146;s Good) To Be
        Free&#148; - from &#147;Whatever&#148; single, &#147;Stay
        Young&#148; - from &#147;D&#146;You Know What I
        Mean?&#148; single, &#147;Headshrinker&#148; - from
        &#147;Some Might Say&#148; single, and &#147;The
        Masterplan&#148; - from &#147;Wonderwall&#148; single.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&gt;&gt; The new solo project
        from the creator of White Zombie hit stores last week.
        Rob Zombie brings us his new project, &#147;Hellbilly
        Deluxe,&#148; equipped with Parental Advisory sticker,
        spooky cover art, even spookier art on the inside. I
        don&#146;t recommend listening to this album alone - or
        at all. Don&#146;t get me wrong, it stays true to Zombie
        form, and is still a talented version of Marilyn Manson.
        It&#146;s loud, hard, and well put together - it&#146;s
        just creepy.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&gt;&gt; On a lighter note, I
        mentioned last week that the Culture Club have released a
        new album. If you have not picked it up yet, you need to.
        It is a double album, with a greatest hits cd and their
        wonderful VH1 Storytellers performance. Both discs
        feature &#147;Church of the Poison Mind,&#148;
        &#147;I&#146;ll Tumble for Ya&#146;,&#148; &#147;Do You
        Really Want To Hurt Me,&#148; &#147;The Crying
        Game,&#148; &#147;Karma Chameleon,&#148; and many others.
        The liner notes to the album are done by Boy George, and
        they are reason enough to buy this album.</strong></font></p>
