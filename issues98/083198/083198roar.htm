        Recent complaints have been submitted about the recent
        disappearance of Greek Organizations signs on the campus
        at Columbus State University. In the past, events of this
        nature have taken place, but obviously people cannot
        comprehend the meaning of respect. Before you do
        anything, always put yourself in the other person&#146;s
        shoes first. How would you like it if someone blatantly
        pulled down your sign for no apparent reason other than
        lack of respect for other people. I feel as if some
        action should be taken in regards to whoever is partaking
        in these destructive acts. However, whoever is
        responsible for these actions need to take into
        consideration the importance of the things that they own
        and how they would feel if someone destroyed anything of
        theirs. No one knows who is the responsible party, Greek
        or Non-Greek, but organizations actually take pride in
        what they do if they need to be reminded. It is also hard
        to progress when you have people who love to take part in
        childish acts instead of trying to progress in a more
        constructive manner. Finally, think before you do
        something that offends other people and makes you look
        bad in the process. </strong></font></p>
