        <td><font size="4"><strong>I am writing this letter due
        to an incident that occurred on 19 August, 1998, while I
        was representing a group during the orientation day for
        new students. I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE ONE OF THE PROSPECTIVE
        STUDENTS, WEARING A SEXUALLY DESCRIPTIVE T-SHIRT, WHICH
        ON THE FRONT APPEARED THE SLOGAN &#147;OFFICIAL MUFF
        DIVING INSTRUCTOR&#148; AND ON THE BACK APPEARED A
        GRAPHIC PORTRAYAL OF TWO DARK SILHOUETTES ENGAGED IN A
        SEXUAL POSITION. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>It
        may be unpopular in such a liberal institution such as
        this one to express disgust over this obvious
        &#147;ABUSE&#148; of the freedom of speech. Yet in an
        environment where mixed gender, parents of new students
        and people who may have religious values that compel them
        to avoid this type of material are sure to mingle the
        thoughtless action of those people who display such
        material is unacceptable. Having spanned a twenty year
        military career, this behavior is not totally new to me,
        but even our maligned service members have some scope of
        how to act in mixed company. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Since it is not expected that
        peer pressure would dissuade these people from this
        behavior, and since peer students have no official
        authority to address these people without enduring a
        fusillade of insults or possible physical altercations,
        it seems that the school faculty should actively work to
        protect an institution of higher learning. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>After all, many of your
        students come from high schools were this type of
        activity is not tolerated. Furthermore the display of
        t-shirt slogans and other benign types of messages can be
        construed as sexually harassing, or perhaps religiously
        so. At any rate, these types of actions cannot make our
        students feel comfortable in a learning environment.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I am not naive in my beliefs
        concerning this matter, and am aware that to many young
        people, this type of material is inoffensive. I do
        believe however, that in attaining a higher academic
        level we should also strive to raise our moral and civic
        responsibilities. Our parents and many of our students
        due not send/attend this place of learning to have their
        children or themselves exposed to these childish immature
        (as opposed to &#147;adult&#148;) materials.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>In my estimation, all faculty
        members should be required to identify such potentially,
        offensive material, and instruct such students to report
        to an assigned authority on such matters who can make the
        final determination on the acceptability of such
        material. In this manner the professors would not be the
        acting authority and any official protest could be
        handled through that authorities office, such as the Dean
        of Students.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>It is well that universities
        are known as a place for open exchange of ideas, but it
        seems to me that those ideas should be tempered in such
        away as not to outright imply an insult, simply for the
        sake of an insult.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I appreciate your indulgence of
        time in considering this matter, and request that you
        discuss it with what ever responsible agent seems
        appropriate to you. I apologize for the graphic material
        that is the subject of this message, but if it is
        offensive or shocking to you perhaps it will relate my
        feelings on the matter.</strong></font></p>

        A.R. Johnson</strong></font></p>
