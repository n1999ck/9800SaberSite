    <td><font size="4"><strong>The Fall Semester began with a bang as of August 24th when
    Columbus State University officially began the 1998-1999 school year. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>The conversion to the semester system was not the only large event that
    hit the campus. Many organizations held events at the clock tower which attracted many
    students and at the same time helped these students to get involved on campus. </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>I was happy to see the increased support of the student
    organizations on campus attempting to encourage involvement on the campus of Columbus
    State University. Another noticeable occurrence on campus is the number of students out
    and about on campus. Columbus State University is slowly moving toward a more traditional
    campus instead of it&#146;s past reputation of being a commuter school. </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>Overall, I am impressed with the interest of the incoming
    students this fall and strongly encourage every student at Columbus State University to
    get involved in any organization on campus. At the same time, I want to encourage every
    organization on campus to get these students involved and make their time at Columbus
    State University successful and enjoyable. </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>As a member of many organizations on campus, I know first hand
    the benefits of being involved. I, like many students on campus, came from somewhere other
    than Columbus. Getting involved solved my problem of both meeting new people and having
    fun. The effects of getting involved have been positive in my life both academically and
    socially. </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>Students, get involved and make CSU a positive aspect in your
    life.</strong></font></td>
