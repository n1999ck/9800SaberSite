<pre><font size="4" face="Times">Eatontown, N.J.-No doubt condoms will make headlines as long as AIDS is an epidemic. </font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">Despite what reporters and consumers think, there are a lot of misconceptions about these latex</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">lifesavers.  The consumer information specialists at Ansell Personal Products, Maker of</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">LifeStyles and other condoms, want to share some surprising facts that may make you laugh.</font></pre>

<p><font size="2"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times"><strong><u>THE BARE FACTS</u></strong></font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">1.  The most common condom mistake is putting on the condom upside down.  It should unroll</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">smoothly and easily from the rim on the outside.  &quot;If you have to struggle, or if it takes more than</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">a few seconds to put on a condom, it's inside out,&quot;says Carol Carrozza, Director of Marketing for</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">Ansell Personal Products.  To take off the condom, don't try to roll it back up.   Hold it near the</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">rim and slide it off.</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times"> </font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">2.  People ask about condom sizes.  It's not like buying a shirt. There generally are three sizes</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">available and size differences are subtle.  For example, Lifestyles Ultra Sensitive is a standard</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">condom size.  The LifeStyles Form Fit condom is contoured to provide a snugger fit for those</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">who prefer it.  Ansell also offers a mega condom that is just 2 mm larger than the standard size. </font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">But sorry, guys, they don't get bigger than this, despite what you claim to need.</font></pre>

<p><font size="2"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">3.  Use a latex condom.  The Centers for Disease Control says that for the sexually active, latex</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">condoms provide the best protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Latex also offers</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">variety.  It can be molded into condoms with bumps, ridges, and different shapes to provide</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">different sensations.</font></pre>

<p><font size="2"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">4.  Condoms are like cartons of milk.  Both have a shelf life and an expiration date on the</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">package. Don't buy old milk or use condoms that's expired.  Condoms with spermicide have a</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">shelf life of three years; those without spermicide have a shelf life of five years.</font></pre>

<p><font size="2"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">5.  The worst place to carry a condom is you back pocket.  Think about how a stick of gum looks</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">after a day in your back pocket, and you'll know why a shirt pocket makes more sense for</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">carrying a condom.  Don't store your condoms for a long time in your glove compartment,</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">pocket, wallet or purse.  Lengthy exposure to heat can break down the latex.  And in purse, keys,</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">pens or other sharp objects can damage if it's not in a protective case.</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times"> </font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">6.  The foil packet has a tear strip; use it. You can damage the condom by tearing open the</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">package with your teeth or something sharp.  Also, once the condom is out of the package,</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">handle it gently.  Jewelry and fingernails often are culprits in tearing condoms.</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times"> </font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">7.  Another common mistake is to pull the condom on too tightly, with no room at the tip.  If the</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">condom doesn't have a reservoir tip, squeeze the end to remove air, and leave a little room at the</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">end.  This is the origin of the condom nickname &quot;Jimmy Hat.&quot;</font></pre>

<p><font size="2"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">8. Body oil, ice cream and whipped cream are fun, but they're not good lubricants for latex</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">condoms because they damage the latex.  Use only water based lubricants. The package will be</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">clearly marked.</font></pre>

<p><font size="2"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times"> 9.  If you feel a condom break, stop and withdraw immediately.  Then use another condom.  If</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">another condom in the same package should break, keep the unused condoms and call the</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">manufacturer.  Lot number tracking will help get to the source of the problem.  Ansell has a toll</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">free consumer line at 1-800-633-0909 if you have any questions about condoms.</font></pre>

<p><font size="2"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times"> 10.  Most people don't realize that condoms are classified as medical devices.  Their production</font></pre>

<pre><font size="4" face="Times">and marketing is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.</font></pre>
