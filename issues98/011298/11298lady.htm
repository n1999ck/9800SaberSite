<p><font size="4"><img src="Lady_Cougars.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="218" height="292"></font><font size="4">For Kennesaw State women s basketball team, the Owls
Nest has been a very comfortable home for the past year, however,
the Nest was raided for the first time in 29 games by the CSU
Lady Cougars. The Lady Cougars used a 20-point outburst by guard
Reagan Housch to defeat the 21st ranked Lady Owls 89-87. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Lady Cougars set the pace of the game by
jumping out quickly to a 20-8 lead. Housch started out sizzling,
hitting on her first four three-point attempts. Kennesaw then
began looking like the same dominating team of the past, taking
the lead and stretching it to as many as 11 points in the second
half. The Lady Cougars kept fighting and clawing and used an 11-2
spurt to pull within two points. In the process of the comeback,
CSU s All-Conference player Que Gilliam fouled out, leaving a big
hole to be filled. Columbus reserves stepped up their play after
Gilliam s departure and helped take the lead and hold on to upset
the Lady Owls. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Along with Housch s 20 points, Tocshia
Campfield added 18 and Carrie Long put in 10. With the victory,
the Lady Cougars raised their record to 7-2, and 2-0 in Peach
Belt play. </font></p>
