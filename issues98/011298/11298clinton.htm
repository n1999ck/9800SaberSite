<p><font size="4">President Clinton proposed an expansion in federal work-study assistance
for college students. The plan is a $70 million plan to expand federal work-study programs
for <img src="clinton.jpg" align="right" hspace="0" width="353" height="238">college
students. Clinton proposed the plan in a speech on Friday while in Texas. The proposal
will be included in Clinton&#146;s budget request for the 1999 fiscal year. The plan will
represent only a modest increase in higher education spending. The new work-study money,
if approved by Congress, would bring the number of students in the program to 1 million
next year, up from about 940, 000 at present according to White House Spokesman Barry
Toiv. <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Clinton also used the speech to call attention to several measures
passed last year to make college more affordable. Under the work study program, colleges
receive federal money to provide jobs for students. Clinton has frequently championed the
program, citing his own student work experience. <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In January 1996, Clinton proposed raising the number of students in
work-study programs by 50 percent, to a total of 1 million, by the year 2000. Congress
created 200,000 new work-study positions in 1996, at an extra cost of more than $200
million.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In a speech on Thursday, Clinton said he also was working to ensure that
people on welfare can qualify for work study aid so they can work their way through
school. Several higher-education aid programs were passed in connection with last
year&#146;s deal to balance the federal budget.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They included &#147;HOPE Scholarship&#148; tax credits up to $1500 to
help pay for the first two years of college, tax credits up to $1000, rising to $2000 by
the year 2003, for third-and fourth-year college students, graduate students, and
continuing education students, and provisions to use money in Individual Retirement
Accounts for college costs. On the United States Government education homepage it says
that &#147;when fully phased in 12.9 million students&#151;5.8 million claiming the HOPE
Scholarship, and 7.1 million claiming the Lifetime Learning Credit&#151;are expected to
benefit each year. <br>
