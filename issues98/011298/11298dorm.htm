<p><font size="4">Change is evident here on our campus of Columbus State University. That
change brings about the development and growth of our school. Along with the growth of the
university comes the growth of the student body. The next step was to find a place for
these new students to live while attending CSU. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Columbus State University, in a joint effort from Student Housing,
Auxiliary Services, and Plant Operations, recently acquired Peachtree Apartments for new
student housing. These apartments are located across the street from the main entrance of
the university, and will be called Courtyard 2. Current housing at Columbus State
University holds approximately 230 students per quarter, with nearly 125 students on a
waiting list for housing. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Maria Holmes, from Auxiliary services, said that the set-up for the
Courtyard 2 would be the same as for Courtyard 1. Remodeling of the apartments has already
begun and will continue right up until Fall semester in August. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Thirty-four apartments will have a one bedroom and one bathroom setup.
Thirty-two apartments will have a two bedroom and one and a half bathroom setup. The <img

twelve apartments will have a three bedroom and two bathroom setup. The new courtyard will
be equipped with an office and a clubhouse. There is no confirmation on if there will be a
swimming pool or not . </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Larry Kees, assistant Vice-President for Student Affairs , played a key
role in the acquisition of the apartment complex. The purchase, which was made final in
November of 1997, will nearly double the housing available to Columbus State University
students. This new housing will not only benefit the students, but will offer much needed
space to bring various camps and organizations to CSU, such as, basketball, cheerleading
and volleyball camps. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The need for new student housing arose when the university had to turn
students away, because of the lack of available housing. Larry Kees commented, turning
people away became very frustrating and we do not want to do that. Purchasing the
apartments was an, instantaneous solution, according to Mr. Kees. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">When Courtyard 2 is fully functional, ten percent of the student body
will live in student housing. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The apartments are open to Columbus State University students and are
available on a first come-first serve basis. A signed contract and a $100 deposit will
reserve you a room in the new Courtyard. The set date that Courtyard 2 will be available
for use is in August 1998. </font></p>
