        through Alabama and Georgia early Thursday. The latest
        estimates said over forty people had been killed in
        Alabama and over eight in Georgia.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong><img src="041398alabama.jpg" align="left" hspace="0" width="315" height="240"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>The hardest hit area was Jefferson
        County, Alabama where rescuers were still searching for
        missing people on Friday. In Jefferson County, searchers
        had found 41 people that had been killed by the storm on
        Friday afternoon and about 200 people were injured. The
        death toll may rise as the searchers continue there
        mission. Experts think three tornadoes hit Jefferson
        County. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Vice President Al Gore surveyed
        the damage on Friday in Alabama and Georgia. He called
        the storm &#147;the most powerful tornado ever seen in
        this part of the country.&#148; Gore also said since the
        impact of the tornado was unprecedented, &#147;the
        response must be unprecedented,&#148; too.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>After surveying the damage the
        National Weather service said the tornado had winds up to
        250 miles per hour in Alabama. This is the second worst
        storm in Alabama history. It was the strongest to hit
        Alabama since a 1977 twister struck Smithfield.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>According to the Alabama
        Emergency Management Agency about 500 homes were
        destroyed or suffered major damage and another 400 homes
        suffered&nbsp;minor damage in Jefferson County and St.
        Clair County. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>President Clinton at a speech
        in Kentucky declared major disaster areas&nbsp;in the
        worst-hit parts of Alabama and Georgia. Governor Fob
        James declared a state of emergency and called out the
        National Guard to assist in the cleanup. Governor James
        said &#147;It&#146;s the worst storm I&#146;ve seen in my
        lifetime.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The most powerful tornado cut a
        15 mile long and one mile wide path and destroyed a high
        school, a fire station and damaged two churches. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The storms Thursday were the
        latest in what has become the deadliest U.S. tornado
        season in fourteen years, experts said. A top weather
        expert said this is shaping up to be the deadliest since
        1984 when 122 people died.</strong></font></p>
