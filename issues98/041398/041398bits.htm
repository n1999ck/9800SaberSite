    <td><font size="4"><strong><img src="crows.jpg" align="right" hspace="0" width="526" height="266">Counting Crows are set to release a double disc live album on June 30. The
    albums main purpose is to appease the fans while the band takes their time recording their
    third album, which is due out in 1999. Counting Crows are Matt Malley on bass, Ben Mize on
    drums, David Bryson on guitars, Adam Duritz on piano and vocals, Dan Vickrey on guitars,
    and Charles Gillingham on piano, accordion, and harmonica. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>The album will consist of two shows the band performed in 1998. The first
    show is from the acoustic VH1 Storytellers. The setlist for that show is as follows:
    &#147;A Long December&#148;, &#147;Angels of the Silences&#148;, &#147;Mr. Jones&#148;,
    &#147;Rain King&#148;, &#147;Catapult&#148;, &#147;Have You Seen Me Lately?&#148;, and
    &#147;Ghost Train.&#148;</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>The second show is MTV&#146;s Live at the 10 Spot. The setlist
    for that show is: &#147;Recovering the Satellites&#148;, &#147;Angels of the
    Silences&#148;, &#147;Rain King&#148; &#147;Goodnight Elizabeth&#148;,
    &#147;Catapult&#148;, &#147;Mr. Jones&#148;, &#147;Omaha&#148;, &#147;Sullivan
    Street&#148;, &#147;Have You Seen Me Lately?&#148;, &#147;Round Here&#148;, &#147;I&#146;m
    Not Sleeping&#148;, &#147;A Murder of One&#148;, &#147;Anna Begins&#148;, &#147;A Long
    December&#148;, and &#147;Walkaways.&#148; </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>Red Hot Chili Pepper&#146;s guitarist Dave Navarro has announced
    that he has left the band. Navarro joined the band in 1994 and only appeared on the 1995
    release One Hot Minute. He will now focus mainly on his project band, Spread, with
    Pepper&#146;s drummer Chad Smith. The Spread album is due out this summer, and the future
    of the Red Hot Chili Peppers is unknown.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>Former Milli Vanilli member Rob Pilatus was found dead in his
    hotel room last week in Frankfurt, Germany. Pilatus has had a history of drug abuse, but
    the cause of death has yet to be determined. He was scheduled to visit India this month
    for another section of his drug rehabilitation. Pilatus, along with Fabrice Morvan, made
    up the late 1980&#146;s group Milli Vanilli, and I do mean that they made the group up.
    Pilatus and Morvan were busted in 1990 for not actually singing on their albums, and their
    Grammy Award was taken away. </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>Despite not actually singing, the duo had several hit songs,
    such as &#147;Girl You Know It&#146;s True&#148;, and &#147;Blame It On the Rain.&#148;
    Morvan has a new album set for release this spring called Love Revolution. It is rumored
    that Morvan actually sings on this album. A movie about the Milli Vanilli story is in the
    works. Pilatus was thirty-two years old. </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>Alanis Morissette and Peter Gabriel both have new songs
    appearing on the soundtrack for the movie City of Angels. The Peter Gabriel song, &#147;I
    Grieve&#148;, is one of the best songs he has done in years. The Morissette song,
    &#147;Uninvited&#148;, is the first new song she has recorded since her album Jagged
    Little Pill. The soundtrack also features U2, Jimi Hendrix, Paula Cole, Sarah McLachlan,
    Goo Goo Dolls, and Eric Clapton.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>Speaking of Alanis Morissette, she is rumored to be involved in
    the upcoming movie &#147;Dogma.&#148; &#147;Dogma&#148; is a religious comedy created by
    Kevin Smith. Smith is the creative force behind the movies &#147;Clerks&#148;,
    &#147;Mallrats&#148;, and &#147;Chasing Amy.&#148; Smith also appears in those movies plus
    MTV commercials as Silent Bob. Alanis Morissette is rumored to be playing the role of God
    in the movie. There is no official word on whether she has signed on for the movie or not.
    &#147;Dogma&#148; will also star Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, both playing angels. </strong></font></td>
