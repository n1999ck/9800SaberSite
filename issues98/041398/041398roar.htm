        &#147;Greeks are only good for one thing and that is a
        party.&#148; People could not be more wrong. As a member
        of a Greek organization, I have personal experience to
        prove these rumors to be false. Research has also
        contradicted the ridiculous rumors conjured up by people
        as well.</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>Greek
        organizations obtain these standards in several ways.
        According to Jim Morris, Director of Student Counseling
        Services at the University of Idaho, Greek organizations
        serve as positive influences. Morris says, &#147; I think
        there is a psychological factor feeling part of something
        supported, the identification within a group. He also
        comments that, &#147; I think that contributes to their
        willingness to stay and progress through school, and
        there is also a fair emphasis in fraternities and
        sororities on academics; an interest in house grade
        performance starting with their freshman year working
        with pledges.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>To further prove
        that Greek organizations excel in academics, the Xi-Iota
        Chapter of Kappa Sigma at Columbus State University has
        shown what diligence and commitment can do. This past
        quarter, Winter &#145;98, Kappa Sigma compiled a total
        cumulative grade point average of 3.11 as a chapter. This
        is the highest GPA the chapter has had and better things
        lie ahead in the future. Brannon Kuykendall, Kappa Sigma
        president comments, &#147; Our current academic
        performance speaks highly of the ideals of our
        fraternity. It is our belief that the primary purpose of
        the collegiate experience is to better oneself
        academically and socially. The diligence and commitment
        the brothers of our chapter have displayed proves that
        the Kappa Sigma Fraternity truly is excellence is action.&#148;
        Jon Gray, Scholarship Chairman, also felt strongly about
        the fraternities progress as well. He states, &#147; Hard
        work and dedication is the key to getting ahead in life,
        no matter what you are doing. As a Kappa Sigma, we strive
        for excellence in and out of the classroom. It is for
        this reason we take such pride in our academic
        achievement.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>Kappa Sigma
        certainly strives for excellence both in and out of the
        classroom. With twenty-two active brothers who pride
        themselves with both active community projects and high
        academic standards, the Xi-Iota Chapter of Kappa Sigma
        proves that Greek organizations are worth more than just
        a party!</strong></font></p>
