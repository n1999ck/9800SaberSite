        has crossed over all the lines typically drawn for
        non-traditional students. After a representative from the
        Student Government Association spoke to her about the
        SGA, she decided to make the best of the time she was
        going to spend in college. </strong></font></p>

        take an active role in student life on campus. She has
        served in every executive office for SGA and is now
        serving as President. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Hurst says, &#147;If I had not
        had some of my friends behind me I could not do all that
        I do. My friend Tracie [Price] started school with me and
        served in SGA with me and I could not have done it with
        out her&#148;. Hurst has served on numerous committees,
        as well as an orientation leader through her years at
        CSU.</strong></font></p>

        love to follow in his mothers footsteps. Hurst&#146;s
        daughter is finishing her Freshman year at Shaw High
        School. </strong></font></p>
