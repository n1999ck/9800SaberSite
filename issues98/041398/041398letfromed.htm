    <td><font size="4"><strong>I was driving down the road the other day, half way listening
    to my radio, when I heard a scary statistic. Columbus is the highest market for the Jerry
    Springer show.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>For the few of you who do not know
    what the Jerry Springer show is let me clue you in. It is an afternoon talk show that has
    very little talking (that you can hear due to the censors) and a lot of WWF action.
    Basically you judge the show by how many &#147;good&#148; fights were on that day. No
    fights means bad ratings for the day. It also appears that most guests have little in the
    common sense department. So in the end you have a lot of angry people speaking profanities
    and trying to get in the best punch.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>Okay now that we have established what it is, let&#146;s talk
    about ratings. The Columbus area is the highest market for the show. The Springer show is
    on NBC and runs up against the CBS and ABC local newscasts. It seems that people are not
    watching the news anymore. </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>One other funny thing about the show is that it is like a cult
    thing. People watch but everyone denies it. Ask anyone about the Jerry Springer show and
    they will know what you are talking about, but then ask if they watch it. Chances are they
    will say they saw one part one day while flipping channels. I know that for a fact because
    that is my line. </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>Yes, Yes I am admitting it. I do understand the attraction for
    the show but not when it runs against our local news cast. I suppose it could be that
    people get burned out by the news after the first commercial break and need a little laugh
    so they turn on Jerry. </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>The newest thing in town is the Jerry Springer hour at the
    Choctaw Grill. Okay this is taking things to an extreme for me. Not only let&#146;s
    secretly watch the ridiculous panel of distinguished guest make idiots of themselves for
    our own amusement. Let&#146;s go drink and watch them with others. It&#146;s like a
    support group for those who are Jerry Springer addicts. What was once a source of
    embarrassment has become an afternoon event. </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>Okay let this be known, I am not passing judgement on those who
    enjoy a slight laugh with Jerry Springer. Let&#146;s just not revel in our own
    disfunctionality by doing it as a hobby. </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>I am not an extremist who thinks this is a sign of the
    deterioration of our society. I only hope people do not watch for intellectual stimulation
    or for matters on their love life. </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>One more item of interest is that Jerry Springer show has signed
    an agreement to stop the violence. Well this makes me wonder. Will the show live or will
    another wild and crazy tactic be used to attract all of us with dull lives. The answer to
    that will have to be a mystery for now. </strong></font></td>
