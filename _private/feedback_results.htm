<p>Dear Staff- 

<p> I have been attempting to establish some sort of group communication between the
editorial staffs of Senior B Division school newspapers, for the purpose of sharing
solutions to common problems, and pounding out ideas to a sounding board. However, I have
had little or not response from &quot;The Saber.&quot; 

<p> If you are not interested, please let me know and I will cross you off of my list. If
you are, please respond. 

<p> By the way, how did Professor Centa die in his office? It must have been very sad. I'm
sorry to bother you if you are grieving. 

<p> Thanks, Stacey McGowen News Editor &quot;The Bell Ringer&quot; 1st Place General

<p> Dear Mr. Mcgee. 

<p> Regarding the recent event which took place between us let me simply say If this is
what you want is an apology then this may be as much as I can give. I do have problems
saying, and hearing what is meant. Maybe what was said should of been worded better. But
when one place says one thing, and someone who has jurisdiction over said area says
something else. You can't help to feel something isn't right somewhere. I do still, and
always will feel EVERYONE should abide by the driving laws. Even the police shouldn't be
exempt. 

<p> I didn;t mean to say anything that might be considerd slander.. To that extent again I
apologize. But the statements have to be made that if the main reason for contacting your
lawyer was to take me to court to get monie from me. That is a hopeless case. Any income
of mine is from a trust. But if you are wanting the apology then you have it. Also to me 

<p> and others this station still reports ways to much on Alabama. Because of that the FCC
has been contacted. 

<p> Lastly, I will contact you as little as possible about anything in the future. This is
as much as I can do. 

<p>

<p>Dear Editor, 

<p> Hello, my name is Rick Zawadzki. I am a self-syndicated cartoonist looking to expand
my strips circulation for the Fall 1999 publishing schedule. During the Spring 1999
Semester three papers decided to give my material a run. The FSView/Florida Flambeau in
Tallahassee, FL, the Central Florida Future in Orlando, FL, and the Eagle in Coral Gables,
FL ran &quot;The Wallnuts&quot; once a week throughout the semester. The Central Florida
Future and the FSView presently publish my strip according to their summer schedule and
the Eagle will resume publication for the Fall of 1999. They have been more than pleased
with the material that they've received. I would like you to check out some samples I have
online at the following web address: 

<p> &quot;<a href="http://members.aol.com/thewallnut">http://members.aol.com/thewallnut</a>&quot;

<p> You will find the 5 strips at the bottom of the page. They are scans of the printed
strips. In addition, I could mail you some actual tear sheets if you'd be interested in
seeing them in printed form. Final production files are sent out in .PDF format. I really
do hope that you enjoy the samples and find them suitable for your publication. I am at a
point where I am gradually trying to increase the circulation of my strip. If you decide
that you'd like to line up &quot;The Wallnuts&quot; for your Fall 1999 publication
schedule please let me know so that we might negotiate an arrangement for a trial run. If
you decide not to please email me back anyways so that I can keep track for my personal
records. Thanks again! 

<p> Best Regards, 

<p> Rick Zawadzki </p>

<p>Dear Saber, 

<p> My name is Richard Martinez and I am interested in becoming a member of the Saber
Staff for the school year of 1999-2000. My question is how would I go about doing this? To
list a few details that might interest you: I was the co-editor of my high school's
newspaper, &quot;Falconian.&quot; I am currently spending my summer working for the local
newspaper as a staff writer. My sister, Vanessa Martinez, has been attending CSU for two
years and will be a senior this year. I also have lived in Columbus for 11 years of my
life. I left Columbus only last year to experience Europe for a year where I graduated
high school a year early. I will be emailing your editor a message from my personal email
for varification that my message was received. Thank you for your cooperation. 

<p> Sincerely, Richard Martinez</p>

<p>Does anyone else feel that there is something wrong with the statement made by the U. of A. junior, Christina Buckelew, in the article, &quot;U. Alabama students join worldwide protest of McDonald's Corp.&quot;?  &quot;They kill them while they're still alive.&quot;  I thought that the generally accepted definition of the word kill is someone or something ending the life of another.  One can't kill somenthing that is not alive.  I have a problem with people who don't think.  I really can't stand a person who joins a cause or protest and never gives any real thought about what it is he or she is fighting for.  That person usually ends up hurting his or her cause by sounding stupid in the newspaper.  It makes sence not to sound uneducated in a statement to a newspaper.  Maybe someone should send her the Saber's In Your Face column, &quot;Think before you speak!&quot;!</p>

<p>Dear Editor,
<p>
After reading the article “Debate over student activity fees began Tuesday in Supreme Court,” in the November 15 issue of the Saber and the Volume I Issue I of the CSU Freethought News, I began to understand why Scott Southworth and other students at the University of Wisconsin would question how their student activity fees are spent. 
<p>
The article “Opinion-by Brian Slack,” in the first issue of the CSU Freethought News , made me wonder if this guy was serious, or perhaps dropped on his head before writing the article. I don’t think Mr. Slack was justified in calling the people of Alabama weak minded because they did not vote to have the lottery. And I definitely believe he went a little over the edge by saying he’s offended by the fact that they’re allowed to breed. My question is, who bred you? Your entire article violates the very reason the Freethought Society was formed. Those people are allowed to feel, think, act, and BE a certain way even if you don’t agree. So who named you the “Oh Educated One” to downplay a group because of their beliefs? 
<p>
After attending the first meeting of the Freethought Society, I decided not to be a part of the group because I don’t share their beliefs. But I would never say they’re weak minded and shouldn’t be allowed to breed. It’s one thing to be a freethinker and another to be down right rude, ignorant, and insensitive to others. I did take the liberty of reading the principles and values of the Freethought Society. Don’t you think your violating those principles and values by criticizing those who don’t believe the same way you do? As I recall, the very reason for the Freethought Society was to get people to accept those who are different, regardless of if they’re gay, atheist, oriental or deformed.  
<p>
Growing up a Christian black woman in America, I have learned to accept some people and some things as they are. Even when our beliefs are totally different. No, I didn’t grow up in the 60’s, but I did grow up in the 70’s, in a majority white town, in the South where racism was very strong (and still exists). I know how it feels to not think, not act and not be like others around you. But I’ve also learned that your life operates by how you choose to accept things. And my brother, you’re doing a very poor job of accepting the fact that some people believe in that higher being called God. Don’t forget that this country was founded on his grounds. And the fact that the CSU Freethought Society probably wouldn’t exist if it were not for the founding of this country, One Nation, Under God, Indivisible, With Liberty and Justice For All. 
<p>
The point I’m making is, be who you’re going to be. Although I am a strong believer in God, I would never knock you for not believing and I would never call you names because you did share my ideas. So keep the bullshit about political crap, fake wrestling, and television not hurting our kids to yourself. Because politics has allowed some of us the opportunity to strive for a higher education, wrestling may be fake, but it kills, and television, let’s just say it’s a strong resemblance of people in the world. Like most people pick and choose the people they hang with and who they let their kids be associated with, the same should go for television, because there are people AND KIDS who mimic what they see and hear, on television or in real life.

<p>This is in response to the article in the opinion section of the newspaper about the Georgia Baptist Convention. I feel as if this claim is completely one sided.  I am not sure what the exact doctrine for Baptists are because I am non-denominational, but I do know that all Christians follow the same book of instructions -- the BIBILE!  God made sex for only reproductive purposes and humans have come to take advantage of it.  The bible speaks against any kind of sexual immorality. Hypocrisy has been going on in many churches for many years, and I feel that a homosexual deacon, preacher, or elder in a church is a hypocrite, because they KNOW better!  If they know enough to take on that title, they should know that sexual immorality is WRONG and sinful.  I also feel that the Georgia Baptist Convention feels that if they allow this to go on, they will one day be punished.  If the church where this sinfulness is going on, continues to allow it, when raptures come, they will be left behind for total destruction.   The bible states in Leviticus 18:22, Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is destable.  And in Leviticus 20:13 it states, fi a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is destable.  They must be put to DEATH; their blood will be on their own heads.   And in 1 Corinthians, in chapter 6, the bible clearly states that anyone who is sexual immoral, idolaters, adulterers, prostitutes, or HOMOSEXUAL offenders will not inherit the kingdom of God.  I agree with the convention not wanting to deal with the situations in that church, if they allow it, the blood stains will not only be on the churchís heads, but also on the Convention it represents.   Now, if that church knows whatís good for all of them, theyíd better start helping to deliver the hypocrites from the sin ASAP.   I am African American, and as far as the Southern Baptist Convention banning blacks, thatís called bigotry.  And they issued an apology.  But, if God says that he will spurt out a lukewarm Christian and a man that hateth his brother hateth him, and again, they will also not inherit the kingdom of God.  And as far as the drinking and clubbing is concerned, TOO MUCH OF ANYTHING IS SINFUL!
<p>
And, Stephanie, I hope that you are just writing some of these statements for the sake of gaining readers of your column.  I totally agree with you having your own mind, but to argue for something you know little about ñthe Bible or Christianity, is one-sided.   Please reply this is a very debatable issue.  Iím sure that my biblical views will outlaw your worldviews any time.  
<p>
Hope to hear from you soon ñStephanie Adams!

To the lady in Fazolies
<p>
I don't know your name but we saw each other in Fazolies, the restaurant on the intersection of Whitesville and Bradley Park on Wednesday Dec.08.  You were eating with whom I would assume to be your parents. The shirt that you were wearing at the time said &quot;1998 Find a date&quot; on your way out I was also walking out and we ran into each other at the door we briefly met said hi and smiled nicely to each other.  Then when I got in my truck and you in your parents car we kept looking at each other as we smiled and waved. Ever since then I have been thinking about that day and of how I would like to meet and speak to you a again.

<p>If you want to improve your study skills there is a book entitled &quot;How to Succeed as a Student&quot; available without cost. It contains advice and tips on how to adjust to college life, live cheaply, study effectively and do better in exams.  You can read it online or download and print up for your own private and non-commercial use.  You can place it in your college library too. I wrote it to help my Freshman students in Australia settle quickly and do better.
<p>
There is also a 26-page booklet entitled ìTips for Graduate Studentsî available for free download, on the same terms.
<p>
In addition, there are a couple of books about cross cultural management problems as they affect doing business with China and Japan.
<p>
You can find them all at:

<p>   For once I had thought I was among adults here at good ole CSU. Yet again I am proven wrong.
As I went to relax between my classes today, I found that someone had broken the OTHER channel 
button on the TV in student lounge. Why is this? Do you feel that insecure about asking to change
the channel that you broke the TV so you wouldnt need to? I mean I dont have a problem with BETV, but
I would like to watch something else than caustic rap videos and inane interviews. Maybe you broke the 
button because (surprise surprise) not everyone would like to watch that channel either. Congratulations, yet
again you have proven the level of intelegence here at Columbus State. I am going to read a book.

<p>Is it just me, or everytime a new semester starts, there is some kind of major construction going on?
I can appreciate the need to improve the school campus, and the need to update current fixtures. 
But couldnt some of this stuff been accomplished during Christmas vacation? I really dont like worrying 
about an errant backhoe or other construction hazards on my way to class.</p>

<p>I want to publicly comment on the treatment of many of our fellow students living in the courtyard II complex, headed by Annetoinette Briley.  Ms. Briley is actually at the top of my complaint list, but first, a few key items to review:
<p>
1. The students in the halls that do not have additional roommates are not at fault for any wrongdoing, but many of the RA's seem to find it offensive and downright criminal that some students can live in an apartment, that WAS ASSIGNED TO THEM, by themselves, so they procede with the usual (or at least that's how it seems to me from this vantage point) treatment of such students with harrasing letters left in doorjambs, spite-filled messages about charging additional money to live in the dorm room, and even threatening to forcibly invade rooms, illegally manhandle others' property, and violate all the civil rights of the said student, without any consideration to the fact that they have no actual right to do so in the res. life book (and yes, I've read it).
<p>
2.  these people also seem to have it in their heads that when they get together, it is quite alright to mention how much they dislike a resident, and plot how to get them to leave, or have them removed (and yes, i've heard them say it, they know who they are...)
<p>
3.  Now, to the subject of Ms. Briley, the most abrasive, conceited, possibly even prejudiced individual that has ever abused their ill-begotten place in society.  This person has, in MULTIPLE AND DOCUMENTED OCCASSIONS, threatened, harrassed, and otherwise treated someone close to me with utter lack of respect, in an attempt to coerce this person into leaving the courtyard dorms (see above for the over-heard comments), and tried to be as mean, uncooperative, and all around terrible in her job as humanly possible.
<p>
What all of this boils down to is that the dorm life in Courtyard II has become a waste of money, time, and now even civil liberties, and since the Public Safety motto now seems to be &quot;we'll try and do all the nothing we can for you&quot;,  it doesn't seem to be safe either, so maybe the lack of resident occupancy could be saying something to Ms. Briley: it's time to move out...</p>

<p>Dear Editor(s):
I am writing in reference to last week's ROAR column. First, I'd like to say that I have several years experience in journalism and have been editor, investigative reporter, feature writer, and an advertising executive for two county newspapers as well as my owning my own marketing and publishing company. So from experience and ethical standards, I find the policy for the ROAR column needs to be addressed. When publishing letters and comments, we NEVER were allowed to publish letters anonyomously. Not only was a name required, but a telephone number too, so that we could obtain verification of the author. We did this for the protection of everyone. Especially in a politically hot climate, we had to guard especially well, for, as well all know, some folks will write just about anything with various motivations and agendas in mind. If I write you an anonyomous letter claiming Dr. Brown to be guilty of some sort of moral turpitude, are you going to print it? Seems you should, in all fairness, by following your own policy. You cannot pick and choose who you are going to allow to be publicly assassinated. 
I think that blatant attack on the SGA president was unfair and uncalled for. It doesn't even sound as if the writer made any attempts whatsoever to alleviate the situation or resolve any conflicts, but instead went on a tirade to embarrass Eddie Gordon. 
I've worked with and known Eddie for two years. We've had some differences and he has his faults AS WE ALL DO. But he has also helped me tremendously and loves his job and will not intentionally try to hurt people. He enjoys this school and wants to see what is best for everyone and has gone out of his way to bring students, SGA, and organizations together. 
I think that this incredibly insulting rant of &quot;Mr. or Ms. Anonyomous&quot; reflects poorly on the Saber, proper journalism and the fairness a newspaper is supposed to exhibit. It also demonstrates extreme cowardice of the author to hide behind the cloak of anonymity. If I feel strongly enough to have something I say printed, you can be certain I am proud to have my name under it.
I ask the entire staff, and Dr. McHenry, the Saber's advisor, to review this policy of the anonymity of the ROAR column and each of you to put yourself in the position of being the target of another attack by someone who has a personal grind to ax, cannot find other methods of conflict resolution, or is just plain out and out mean.
Sincerely Yours,
Lisa Grant
President, Freethought Society</p>

<p>You young people need to take a look at our political parties in government!
Hi, I just sent out my book, free and entirely at my own personal expense, &quot;America Needs a New
Constitution?&quot;, to ALL the daily newspapers (about 1400) and to about 250 organizations and
candidates and newsmedia. Basically, it is about a no-party system. The list of grievances run from
campaign contributions to Supreme Court kingly rulings to federal courts cancelling election results to
the antics in our courtrooms. At the end is a comprehensive plan, albeit radical -- THE PEOPLE have
to VOTE and VOTE OFTEN, about how to change the system. I am down to my last 6 copies. I have
$9000 invested in this publication but I am not selling any books. It did not copyright it. I would like,
however, to get a copy into your hands. I prefer to send you the entire book by e-mail (400KB), if you
are willing to print it up. It is 50,000 words and 120 pages (or 60 two-sided). If interested, I can be
reached at  Hank Ohlen; 3536 Colorado NE, Albuquerque, NM, 87110-2114   (505) 881-1592    
hro32nm@twrol.com   in Write, Works, Word, WordPerfect5x, Works for MacIntosh
Goal: a no-parties system. Items: Monthly elections minimal; Second Bill of Rights; national elections -
consecutively - for president, then V-P, then Speaker of House; Constitutional &quot;interpretation&quot;;
Leadership Academies; the Recall; building Election Centers; Congressional District Juries; limitations
on law school students and graduates.

<p>no local paper coverage on this important national story...why?news tip/whistleblower wins harassment vs Ft Benning/alleges gun running on base
<p>
Illegal, stolen M-16s in your backyard?  Army at Ft. Benning alledged to have successfully kept on base gun running ring from from civil and military justice, the media, and from elected officials since 1991.
<p>
Whistle blower wins case for harassment vs Army.  This is Ft. Bennings first loss of this kind.  Media is refused access to hearing for damages last week.
<p>
I would hope that your office will get involved before the Army successfully keeps this story from reaching the public.  See below:
<p>
<p>
March 2, 2000
<p>
Information regarding a whistle blower vs. the U.S. Army.  
<p>
The Army has been found guilty of retaliation against the whistle blower in this case and a hearing for awarding damages has been set for Feb. 29th with a Federal Judge at Ft. Benning ,GA.
<p>
The harassment stems from allegations of military personnel diverting military funds and armaments to supply and organize an illegal gun-running operation at Fort Benning Georgia.
<p>
UPDATE:  Feb 29th  Various media arrived to cover the hearing today and were met by military police per orders from the Commanding General of the base (it is an open base, no guard gates, perimiter fences) and escorted off the base accompanied by military police with lights and sirens.
<p>
UPDATE: March 1
I have been told that the MP's are strategically placed around the base hospital today.  A gag order has been issued (by the Army? the Judge?) to everyone not to talk with Susan or anyone about this case.  The Army is worried about the media getting this one.  Ann Norfolk, the Army attorney, was at the hospital early this morning and was overhead saying as she went into an office... &quot;We have got to do something about this.&quot;
<p>
UPDATE: March 2, 2000
The Commanding General of the base will be issuing a formal military 'gag order' as early as tomorrow in an attempt to keep this illegal gun-running story away from the public and the media in particular. 
<p>
Earlier, the Army was found guilty of harassing the whistle blower when she attempted to go through channels to expose the illegal activity.  (Full story below)
<p> 
There is a great concern with officers at the base that individuals talking with the whistle blower, Susan, may be encouraged to follow her example, or gain information about the case that may reach the 'outside.'
<p>
The Federal Judge in the case (the hearing was blocked to the public and held on the Ft. Benning Army base Feb 29) had earlier asked the lawyers and hearing participants from discussing details of this hearing regarding damages to be awarded, but the military gag order will likely be much broader.  The Judge is currently considering the award for the whistle blower.
<p>
There are appox 30,000 people on this base that will apparently come under the General's order not to mention anything they know to the public.
<p>
The day of the hearing, the General ordered media waiting to cover the event off the base with military escort/lights and sirens.  The base is without guard shacks and perimeter fences...it is an open access base except in this case.
<p>
A copy of the General's order will follow when it is issued.
Reason for hearing:  First phase of this lawsuit is complete and the U.S. Army has been
                                    found guilty of retaliation against a whistle blower at Fort Benning
                                    Georgia.  This upcoming hearing, the second phase, will be

Summary:
<p>
The purpose of this letter is to inform you of the pending case against the U.S. Army and a whistle blower at Fort Benning, Georgia.  In this case, the Army has already been found guilty by a Federal Judge of retaliation against this whistle blower and is now in the position of having to settle for damages with this individual.
<p>
<p>

<p>
<p>
It is very important that the American public be made aware of this case and its ramifications.  So far, the Army has been able to keep the bulk of this case and its potentially explosive ramifications from the public, the Congress, the FBI, and others.  Since this damaging case has so far proceeded beyond the scrutiny of the public, guilty individuals have eluded serious punishment and the U.S. Army has avoided a media nightmare.
<p>
The story begins after the close of the Gulf War.  In the spring and summer of 1991, the Army was shipping considerable amounts of military gear from the war theater back the United States.  Fort Benning was receiving rifles and other military supplies in large quantities.  
<p>
The Fort Benning hospital (706-544-4618) has a medical library.  The medical library and at the time was Hugh Thomas.  Mr. Thomas ran an illegal gun selling business out of the medical library with the apparent consent of the commanding officer of Fort Benning.  
<p>
The whistle blower, Susan, was an employee in this library.  Susan's ratings as an employee in this library were very high.  In fact, she was the employee of the quarter prior to this incident.  In the library, large and heavy boxes (4 feet by 18 inches) were delivered and the instructions to Susan was that these boxes were only to be opened by Mr. Thomas.  These boxes were transported by Fort Bennnings internal distribution system.  The contents did not originate off base.  The clear implication is that these weapons were originating from the base Armory and that individuals were stealing these weapons, repacking them, and shipping them internally to the base library where they would be received and subsequently illegally sold by Hugh Thomas.
<p>
In 1991, Hugh Thomas informed Susan that he would not be in the library for a number of days.  During his absence, Susan had to open these boxes because of a lack of space in the library. The first box opened contained Army M.-16 machine guns.  Susan immediately took these weapons to Col. Franz were put them under his desk.  Col. Franz ordered Susan not to open any more of those boxes, and that she had no business doing so. It should be noted that Col. Franz and Hugh Thomas were close friends.  Also note that the weaponry given to Col. Franz has disappeared and that the Col. denies that he ever had the weapons in his possession.
<p>
Upon Mr. Thomasí return, Susan was confronted by him.  Her goal was to get Mr. Thomas to stop this operation.  His reply was to threaten her life.  This threat was made in the presence of a major McBride and others as they were doing other duties within hearing range of Mr. Thomasí threat.  Major McBride was later transferred to Korea where she was interrogated by FBI agents who were investigating this death threat. 
<p>
When Susan took this matter up the chain of command, to Col. Franz, she was met with an immediate and negative reaction. Steps were not taken against Mr. Thomas, or those implicated by the presence of M16s in the base library. However, Susan suddenly became a target of ever-increasing harassment and personal pressure.
<p>
A couple of examples of this operation, and of the possible complicity of others in protecting Mr. Thomas in this operation, can be illustrated quite simply.  This gun running operation has a business name, &quot;Square Deal Gunshop&quot;, and business cards to that affect were obtained by the Army auditor (mentioned later) and one of these cards is in the possession of Susan's attorney in this case, James Patrick.  
<p>
Additionally, and most blatantly, Mr. Thomas was repairing guns in one of the offices on the library premises and was selling guns to individuals (bona fide, tattooed, skin heads included) on the base parking lot. Susan's attorney has indicated that any media attending this hearing can later join him at the base parking lot to see the site of many of these illegal gun sales.
<p>
Page 3        Whistle blower/Army retaliation-settlement hearing
<p>
During the time of this illegal gun running operation at Fort Benning, an arrest was made against three (Army?) sergeants involved in the illegal sales of machine-gun barrels.  Additional information regarding this case is available from Mr. Patrick.
<p>
To continue, months have gone by, and Susan is under increasing pressure and threats from base personnel.  At this point, an Army internal investigator is made aware of Susan's case, and Susan has been asked by the FBI to testify before a federal grand jury in the spring of 1995.  
<p>
This Army auditor had been recently named The Medical Auditor of the Year and the World by the U.S. Army.  Shortly after the this auditors investigation of this case, the investigator met with her own form of intimidation. 
<p>
Upon entering her office one workday (she has the only key) she found a single bullet sitting upright on her desk.  This distinguished investigator felt compelled to remove herself from the case.
<p>
Susan continued an attempt to bring this gun running operation and the individuals involved, to justice.  She wrote a series of letters to Janet Reno, Newt Gingrich, House majority leader and Senator of Georgia, the President and First Lady, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and others of high standing.
<p>
Also, Sen. Specter became involved in this investigation.  The degree of information known by these individuals, their action taken, letters, and memorandum are available from Susan's attorney, Mr. Patrick.
<p>
It should also be noted that the pressure brought to bear against Susan was steadily increasing.  U.S. Army supervisors were aware that the Executive and Congressional branches of government had been informed and subsequently the investigative offices of each of these government branches had been activated.  Rather than investigating these criminal allegations, the U.S. Army was now in an expanded cover-up mode.
<p>
At some point during these concurrent investigations, the Secretary or acting Secretary of the U.S. Army contacted these investigating individuals via a letter and told them that Susan was essentially crazy and this case was for all practical purposes without merit. 
<p>
<p>
Unknown to the investigating individuals, the Secretary of the Armyís office had a very thick and complete file referencing the allegations and the individuals implicated. A good portion of this file consisted of the written responses made by the Army internal investigator as a reply to questions asked by her superiors.  The contents of this file contain considerable information outlining illegal activities in regards to the gun running operations and other illegal activities on base.  This Army auditor has testified to this effect.  Information also kept from Sen. Specter and other outside investigators was that the FBI was running a very active investigation into the illegal activities at Fort Benning.  Both Susan and the Army Auditor were being contacted by FBI agents assigned to them.  The agents were in part checking to see if death threats were being carried out, and one of the agents was required to submit daily reports on this case.
<p>
It was also known to the Army at this time that Susan had in her possession a computer print-out from Hugh Thomas' computer file clearly listing and implicating gun buyers and sellers, civilians and military personnel.  Some of these entries referenced Middle Eastern addresses.  
<p>
This letter, released by the Army and sent to investigators, was signed by the acting Secretary of the Army, John Shannon, and its effect was swift and successful.  Acting Secretary Shannon 
Page 4        Whistle blower/Army retaliation-settlement hearing
<p>
<p>
indicates that allegations were investigated by an Army officer specifically appointed for that purpose and that the investigators found that most of the allegations were substantiated..
<p>
Further, the Secretary indicates that the Army is essentially handling it.  The last paragraph states ìAfter I reviewed the investigators report I directed that action be taken to implement all 10 of the recommendations set forth on the last page of his report.  I expect these actions to be completed 
in the next few months.).î   This letter is date April 20th, 1993, and a copy is available from Susanís attorneys office.  
<p>
Sen. Specter dropped his investigation and the FBI investigative support for the case appeared to wane.  In the months following Mr. Shannon's official role in signing of this document, he was subsequently arrested for shoplifting or theft at an Army base PX.  
<p>
Secretary of the Army Shannon made national headlines.  While being interviewed on television, Mr. Shannon said that he had been framed.  Perhaps Mr. Shannon has legitimate information that needs revealing.  More details all are available from Mr. Patrick.
<p>
Please remember that originally, Susan went up the chain of command to the boss of Mr. Hugh Thomas, and appealed to Col. Charles Franz.  Col. Franz and his wife, P. G. (Phyllis?) Franz were avid supporters of the president and Mrs. Clinton.  Their support and connectivity is revealed by the fact that they arranged a bus tour for the Clintons while in Georgia and additionally sponsored a fundraiser for the Clintons in the Franz home.  The Colonel and Mrs. Franz are now divorced, the Colonel living in Alaska and Mrs. Franz currently living in Columbus, Georgia.
<p>
Additional events need to be brought to your attention.  During this period of time, the Army is apparently in a cover-up mode, outside investigators are been misled or intimidated, and Susan is under tremendous pressure and personal threat. 
<p>
Fort Benning received into its hospital wards a patient unknown at the time, Timothy McVeigh. It is a common practice for military personnel with psychological problems to be taken from active duty arenas and brought to a military hospital such as Fort Benning for evaluation and possible treatment.  Details of this transfer can be obtained from the attorney.
<p>
Mr. McVeigh was discharged from the hospital after a short period of time (details unknown to me) in 1995.  Mr. McVeigh was found to be the man responsible for the Oklahoma City bombing horror.  Mr. McVeigh's presence at Fort Benning may be purely coincidental to the illegal gun running activities and the seemingly protected individuals operating there, but the reaction by the FBI the day after the bombing is unsettling and alarming.  
<p>
Following the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the FBI agent that was Susan's contact called her.  He said words to this effect, &quot;Are you sitting down?  The FBI has closed the investigation in your case.&quot;  It was apparent that the agent was not happy about the investigation being closed. 
<p>
Also, the Army Auditor indicated that the files on Timothy McVeigh vanished approximately two weeks after the Oklahoma City bombing. 
<p>
 Any further information about the FBI or the attorney general's office closing this important investigation on that date is beyond my knowledge, but additional details or documents may be available through Susan's attorney.  I do recall that Susan's attorney notified the defense and prosecution teams for the Oklahoma bombing trial and made them aware of the some of the gun running-details of Susan's case, as well as McVeigh's admission into the Fort Benning hospital. 
<p>
Page 5        Whistle blower/Army retaliation-settlement hearing
<p>
<p>
To date, there is available evidence from Mr. Hugh Thomas' own documents that provides details of this operation, a letter from the office of the Secretary of the Army giving incomplete information to various investigators, the Army's substantial files on this case, and the testimonies of Susan, numerous co-workers, and friends.  
<p>
In Susan's first hearing before a Federal Judge, her case against the Army resulted in the Army being found guilty of retaliation against her.  This is the only legal exposure the Army has had in this entire incident.
<p>
On Feb. 29th, 2000, another federal judge will open proceedings to examine harm and award appropriate damages.
<p>
This is the first case of this kind found against the Army at Fort Benning.  Although the Army has been found guilty and liable of harassment, the Army, authorities at Fort Benning, and seemingly guilty parties may never be investigated or brought to justice without media attention.
<p>
Currently, the librarian at Fort Benning, Hugh Thomas, has been transferred and is now a librarian for another army facility in New York State. Despite the considerable testimony and criminal evidence brought against him and his participation in the harassment, Mr. Thomas has benefited from an increase in his G.S. rating and a subsequent raise in pay. 
<p> 
To my knowledge, the criminal activity alleged in this case, and the individuals that make up this illegal weapons theft and sale. are not under investigation, nor has any individual or organization been brought up on any charges by civilian or military courts.
<p>
Hopefully, you will make an effort to investigate this case, and also attend the hearing on Feb. 29th.  It will not appear in a public courtroom, but in an auditorium at Fort Benning.
<p>
My part in contacting you is to support my courageous friend Susan and by doing so, to execute my responsibilities as a citizen.  This is an effort by a number of citizens attempting to bring about a proper investigation and to see that the law is appropriately enforced, without exclusions, to any individual or group in this case.
<p>
There are other stories about Fort Benning for others to tell.  To my limited knowledge, they have no direct bearing to this case, but sadly they also bring serious charges about events on this base.
<p>
This exhausts my knowledge in bringing this information to you.  Thank you for your consideration.  
<p>
For further inquiries please contact: 
<p>
Attorney James D. Patrick, Columbus, Georgia, at 706-322-7181.
<p>
I failed to mention earlier that this base wins the Army post of the year most every year.  They have a sign outside the base that says you are now leaving the best post in the world, or something to that effect.
<p>
Also, upon the death of Susanís mother, Susan was not allowed to leave work until the end of her shift, unless she wanted to risk firing and subsquient loss of pensions, etc as a result.  The then attended to her deceased mother after she got off work that day.

<p>I have been trying to contact The Saber staff to get information on your budget.
I'm putting together a spreadsheet on the budgets of schools comparable to our
school's sizes, and I'd be glad to send your paper a copy (it's really quite facile).
But, I cannot find CSU's information. What is your total annual budget? The number
of paid staff? How is the staff compensated? How many people do you have on
staff? How much is allowed for conventions and conferences?
<p>
Thank you so much for participating.

<p>Tuesday night, March 14th, Crosby Stills Nash &amp; Young demonstrated for 3Ω hours that they still hold patents on harmony and classic rock.  From &quot;Carry On,&quot; thru &quot;Southern Man,&quot; &quot;Ohio,&quot; &quot;Stand &amp; Be Counted,&quot; and an encore performance of &quot;Long May You Run,&quot; the sold-out crowd at Atlanta's Philips Arena was reminded of what was, what is, and what could be, by these masters of romantic and social-activist music.  I had waited 26 years to experience this live again, and I was prepared for some evidence of loss of technical quality and perhaps dexterity due to their advanced ages.  Instead, Crosby &amp; Nash harmonized beautifully on &quot;Gwenevere,&quot; Stills was jumping about the stage with &quot;For What It's Worth,&quot; and Neil Young exemplified the definition of 'rockin' on guitar, harmonica and even pipe organ with &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot; and &quot;Down By The River&quot; in ways that brought tears of appreciation and people dancing in the aisles.</p>

<p>Dear Saber,
<p>
   I am writing in response to the article written about Neal Fenter and &quot;Buried Child&quot;. I feel that the remarks made about Mr. Fenter were judgemental, rude and uncalled for. First of all, anyone who claims to be a &quot;former thespian&quot; should know that opening night between acts is an inappropriate time to attempt to conduct an interview with the director. Secondly, the free publicity the &quot;Journalist&quot; claims to have been motivated to give would have come to late. For publicity purposes you would need to print the article before the show opens not after the run is over.  I am a former journalist myself and I understand the incredible importance of correctly qouting a source! As an awe inspired student of Mr. Fenter's I feel that you may have been mistaken about remarks made that evening. Neal Fenter is one of the most caring, honest mentoring teachers I know at Columbus State. He inspires and pushes his theatre students to achieve things beyond their comprehention. In refrence to Mr. Fenter's &quot;ignorance&quot; of the Saber, I would like to point out that he has given interviews to journalist for the Saber about previous shows. Neal Fenter is well aware of the various organizations at CSU being an active part in Administrative activites and organizations. In addition to being a full time professor Mr. Fenter directs and is chair of the Honors Convocation for CSU. He has been a dedicated and valued part of this University and I feel that he was unjustly wronged the day that article was printed! I feel that an apology is in order!
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>
Jason Williams</p>

Internet CD Rewards Program Channels Profits Back to Customers  
<p> 
SACRAMENTO, CA ó All of the World.com launches a program called &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; tomorrow at 
midnight on their website at www.alloftheworld.com . The program will reward CD buyers who perform word of 
mouth marketing with cold, hard cash.
<p>
Keeping CD prices and shipping among the least inexpensive on the internet, the company has adopted a &quot;Robin 
Hood&quot; strategy, according to president Patrick Islip, CPA, to pay out profits to their customers instead of spending 
their marketing dollars on conventional advertising.
<p>
Islip founded the company in 1999 and has made it their mission to make the benefits of the internet available to 
anyone. &quot;I would be overjoyed to write checks for $17,000 or more every month to college students, stay-at-home 
mothers, retirees or anyone on a fixed or limited income. That, for me, is the revolution that the internet has 
brought about in our lives.&quot;
<p>
Participants can earn on every CD they buy as well as for every purchaser they refer to site. Referral revenue can 
extend down four levels. Participants can be paid for every CD purchased by everyone they refer to the site, and 
everyone referred by them and so on.
<p>
To kick off the offer, All of the World.com will launch an open enrollment period. For a period of  48 hours 
starting at 12:00 AM Thursday morning, any visitor to the site can register for the full four levels of referral 
revenue income. After the open enrollment period expires, new registrants who aren't directly referred by a 
registered participant are automatically restricted to only two levels of referral revenue.

						director@generationnet.org
<p>
New site: GenerationNet.org is a voice for young people
<p>
Asks &quot;If you could change any US law, what would it be?&quot;
<p>
<p>
GenerationNet.org, a new nonprofit group, has just launched a website
enabling young people nationwide to democratically choose their own public
policy agenda, while joining together to campaign for changes on the policy
issues they choose. 
<p>
&quot;GenerationNet.org is a powerful new voice for young people in America,&quot;
said Peter Schurman, the group's Executive Director. &quot;For the first time,
young people throughout the country can come together on the net, decide for
themselves what changes they want, and work together to hold politicians
accountable for results.&quot;  
<p>
GenerationNet.org was founded in 1999 as a nonpartisan, web-based advocacy
organization for young people.  Although it sets no age boundaries for
membership, it appeals to those born after the baby boom, generations known
as &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;.  It has been initially funded by grants from: Morton
Meyerson; Allen &amp; Company; and Jim Carlisle.  GenerationNet.org won the
$10,000 Social Entrepreneurship Prize in the Yale Entrepreneurship Society
business plan competition on April 8th. 
<p>
GenerationNet.org's founders represent an ethnic, geographic, and
nonpartisan cross section of young people ranging in age from high school
through working professionals.  Founders include experienced nonprofit
organizers who have played key roles in such victories as: building public
support for eliminating the federal budget deficit; passing the California
Desert Protection Act; and encouraging President Clinton to play a leading
role in supporting cleaner air.

<p>Dear Advertising Manager,
<p>
I am writing from the Hispanic Scholarship Fund,
to request a sample issue of your collegeís paper, 
along with a media-package, and rate card.
<p>
HSF is planning to test-market this year, by
placing small ads in targeted college newspapers
to promote our General Scholarship Program,
and we could use your help and ad suggestions.
<p>
We hope that carefully placed ads in August/September,
along with our media announcement and press release,
will increase the number of eligible students we reach each year.
<p>
The Hispanic Scholarship Fund is a not-for-profit organization. Since 1975
weíve awarded $47 million to students of Hispanic background
Last year we awarded over nine-million dollars to more than
Four-thousand students nationwide.
<p>
Please send your paperís information to:
Walt Anthony
General Program Scholarship Coordinator
Hispanic Scholarship Fund
One Sansome Street, Suite 1000

<p>Hello:
<p>
You may be aware that several new organizations have organized on campus recently.  I am the coordinator for Environmental Action! which recently chartered with the SGA and have been meeting since January.
<p>
We are committed to preserving the natural environment and to that end have various speakers at our meetings which are pertinent to current environmental issues.
<p>
Additionally we participate in pubic comment periods for Environmental Impact Statements and wetland draining permits as well as new environmental legislation.
<p>
Several member sit on the Columbus Greenspace Committee and we are concerned about greenspace preservation and preventing urban sprawl.  
<p>
We are participating in the relicensing of several dams on the Chattahoochee in the hopes that we can increase the required minimum flow downstream or have the dams removed all together.  
<p>
Lately we have been actively lobbying the City and EPA to enforce the Clean Air Act in Columbus.  Local air quality is in vioaltion of the law and our city officials are attempting to mislead citizens and sidestep the regulations.
<p>
If any of this sounds interesting to you I would be happy to answer questions or come by for an interview regarding our organization.  
<p>
Thank you,
<p>
Nathan Boddie

We thought your classified section would be a good avenue for us to search for such students. Could you let me know how to go about placing an announcement in your classified section? Thank you.

   I teach at Jordan High School and will be in charge of the school newspaper this year. I was wondering if someone on the Saber staff might be able to give me some pointers on layout options (programs, etc) and maybe some helpful tips for managing a newspaper. I would appreciate a reply as soon as possible as I only have about a week and a half left before school begins. I apologize for the late notice! 

Thanks,

First of-a-kind sauna treatment center opens in Woodstock!

Sauna Care Center, Inc. has opened a facility at 160 Towne Lake Parkway that offers the latest technology in Radiant Heat Infrared Saunas to the public in two unique approaches to the market.

The first concept gives you the opportunity to purchase timed sessions in their units and the second approach allows you the purchase a unit for your home or business with their °ß try it before you buy it°® concept. 

Sauna Care Center combines the ages old tradition of heating the body for better health with the latest technology for more penetrating heat.  Each session is provided in a private room that contains an individual whole body unit with a bench and reading light.  Each room provides a dressing area, filtered water, clean towels and an individual tape/disc/radio player.

The infrared light used in these saunas is the same harmless light we receive from the sun.  Imagine yourself outside on a spring day enjoying the warm sun.  A cloud comes over the sun and blocks the light, you immediately feel cooler but the temperature of the air around you has not changed.  The infrared light generated by the Sun caused the warm feeling you received.  Do not confuse infrared light with ultra violet light that can cause sunburn.

The infrared sauna provides comfortable deep penetrating heat to help your body naturally reduce pain, ease stress, remove toxins and burn large quantities of calories and numerous other benefits.  The infrared light heats objects instead of the air around an object. This means the air temperature of the conventional sauna or steam room is going to be a great deal higher than with an infrared sauna.  The lower temperature allows you to be more comfortable and stay for a longer session enabling you to gain more of the benefits available from heat therapy.

The deep heat increases the circulation of blood and increases the amount of oxygen delivered to the body tissues.  This helps speed the healing process and aids in reducing pain in chronic conditions such as:  back pain, shoulder pain, muscle spasms, arthritis, rheumatism, bursitis and 
fibromyalgia.  The soothing, gentle warmth of infrared heat also soothes nerves and eases tense muscles. 

Radiant heat produced by infrared light causes you to perspire much more than conventional °ßheat rooms°® because the deep heat and increased blood circulation stimulate the sweat glands more effectively.  Sweating releases built-up toxins and waste helping to detoxify your body of heavy metals, alcohol, nicotine, sodium, sulfuric acid and cholesterol.  Toxin removal leads to a cleaner healthier body.

Sweating is part of the complex process that allows the body to regulate its temperature.  This whole process involves increasing the heart rate, cardiac output, and metabolic rate.  This process consumes a lot of energy and burns a lot of calories.

The Journal of the American Medical Association (8/7/81) states that in a 30-minute sauna session you may burn as many calories as you would at peak output on a rowing machine or running for 30 minutes.  Weight loss is possible because fat becomes water soluble at 110Ña F and the body can eliminate fats through sweating and other methods to eliminate fluids from the body.

The Sauna Care Center is located at 160 Towne Lake Parkway, Woodstock, Georgia  30188.  For more information contact Starr Rowland 770-592-8883 or www.saunacarecenter.com.

An alternative magazine for mainstream people, Events Quarterly, established 3 years ago, has made its way into homes in 30 countries, spanning every inhabited continent on earth.  Events Quarterly (EQ) is a different kind of entertainment magazine, offering news, entertainment, arts, and politics.  Owner and editor of the publication, Ryan D. Brinkhurst, mentions that EQ is &quot;for people who want different points of view without blame.&quot;  The issue of &quot;blame&quot; is that many alternative points of view &quot;blame everyone who is not poor or not actively involved in PETA,&quot; says Ryan.  However, EQ more carefully examines international political issues.  &quot;Sure, we have articles that blame Bush for everything, but we also have articles that praise Bush for his leadership; we are not taking sides.  We are providing several, fair points of view,&quot; says Ryan.

Events Quartery&#39;s most recent issues include interviews with New York Times best seller Steve Alten, and popular New York City artist Susan Ritter.  EQ&#39;s autumn edition, due out on September 21, will include an interview with multi-platinum selling pianist Jim Brickman.  Ryan is not concerned with how many people are talking about EQ; he cares more about how many people are reading the magazine.  He points out that EQ is not the sort of magazine people read once because everyone else is reading it.  &quot;It is a magazine that people keep reading because they want to,&quot; says Ryan.

Often, people think arts and politics do not mix, but Ryan calls politics the &quot;perfect side dish for art, literature, music, and entertainment.&quot;  He brings politics into the artistic forum, suggesting that politicians are entertainers, and entertainers are often involved in politics.  EQ is not taking a satirical look at either entertainment or politics; it is recognizing that citizens of the world are interested in all public figures.

Ryan D. Brinkhurst is a graduate of English and Politics from Trent University.  In 2000 he started a small internet magazine in hopes of reaching a wide audience.  With his aspirations to be a writer and his political knowledge, the next logical step was to create Events Quarterly.  The growth of EQ, in only 3 years, is unprecedented.  EQ is doubling its reader base yearly.  Event Quarterly can be seen online at <a href="http://www.eventsquarterly.com/">http://www.eventsquarterly.com/</a>

I myself am a freshman at CSU and I was contemplating using my writing skills to touch the campus and join the SABER team, but now is not the case. I cannot believe how this person used her publishing ability to put out such a rude way of thinking to readers.  It is just wrong. The way she &quot;bashed&quot; the greek life at this school was just improper. It was degrading and distasteful. I hope to see more articles that are useful to the school&#39;s students, and not some gossip column putting down the fine organizations that lead this school.</p><hr><p><b>txtName: </b>Saadia Carnes<br><b>txtEmail: </b>carnes_saadia@colstate.edu<br><b>chkCSUStudent: </b>ON<br><b>chkCSUFaculty: </b><br><b>chkOther: </b><br><b>txtOther: </b><br><b>rdoComment: </b>V1<br><b>rdoSuggestion: </b><br><b>rdoComplaint: </b><br><b>Submit: </b>Submit<br><b>Date: </b>9/8/2003<br><b>Time: </b>10:33:53 PM<br><b>Remote Name: </b>168.26.198.12<br><b>Remote User: </b><br><b>HTTP User Agent: </b>Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows 98; Win 9x 4.90; FunWebProducts)<br></p><h3>txtMessage</h3><p>I was just wondering how I can get involved with Saber.

This spring, a groundbreaking  circumcision lawsuit was settled in New
York, although terms of the settlements have not been made public.

William Stowell filed suit in 2000 against the hospital where he was
circumcised in 1981 as a newborn, and against the physician who
circumcised him, seeking $75,000 in damages.

Stowell&#39;s case did not claim an unexpected outcome, but questioned whether
a physician could legally and ethically remove normal, healthy  tissue
from a non-consenting minor for non-therapeutic  reasons. David Llewellyn,
one of Stowell&#39;s attorneys, stated, &quot;I would expect that this is just the
first of many cases that will be brought by angry circumcised young
men against their circumcisers.&quot;

In 1971, the American Academy of Pediatrics found no medical justification
for routine circumcision. No  national medical group in the world today
recommends routine circumcision.

For further information on this case, see:
<a href="http://mensnewsdaily.com/archive/newswire/nw03/mnd/newswire042903.htm">http://mensnewsdaily.com/archive/newswire/nw03/mnd/newswire042903.htm</a>

<a href="http://www.cirp.org/news/ABCnews03-12-01">http://www.cirp.org/news/ABCnews03-12-01</a>

A second similar lawsuit was filed on June 26, 2003 in Georgia by William
Haynes, Jr.  Haynes was born on June 28, 1983, and he is suing the
physician and hospital responsible for performing an elective circumcision
upon him after birth.

Currently, an essay contest for college students is being held to answer
the question &quot;Is Circumcision Ethical?&quot; First prize is $1,200, and essays
must be submitted by November 1, 2003.  For more information, go to
