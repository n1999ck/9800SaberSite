        <td><font size="4">A record crowd of 1,612 screaming fans
        saw the Columbus State men&#146;s basketball team avenge
        an earlier loss to the second place Kennesaw State Owls
        recently. </font><p><font size="4">The Cougars found
        themselves trailing the rival Owls 33-25 at halftime but
        came out of the locker room firing on all cylinders.
        Senior Larry Coates scored 17 of his game-high 23 points
        in the second half. Coates seemed to take over the game
        in the second half as he hit from every possible spot on
        the floor, including several monster three-point shots.
        Columbus was also boosted by a stellar performance from
        senior forward Will Dickerson. Dickerson pulled down 19
        rebounds and scored ten points. Dickerson also set the
        Woodruff Gym crowd to its feet with a thunderous
        rejection of a potential dunk by Kennesaw. The victory
        extended Columbus&#146;s home winning streak to 15. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Unfortunately for the Cougars, 15 games
        was as high as it would go. After a road victory over
        non-conference Morris Brown, the Cougars lost their
        second conference game of the season as the
        USC-Spartanburg Rifles spanked Columbus in front of a
        Woodruff Gym crowd of 879. Spartanburg jumped on the
        Cougars early as Columbus shot only 39 percent in the
        first half. The Rifles led by as many as 20 points in the
        second half before the Cougars began to make a charge.
        With 5:13 left in the game, Columbus cut the Spartanburg
        lead to only four on a Calvin Hill steal and layup.
        Spartanburg then responded with several three-point
        baskets to extend their lead. Columbus never folded but
        could never quite catch up as the Rifles took the game
        68-64. With the loss, the 18th ranked Cougars fell to
        18-4 overall and 7-2 in the Peach Belt. </font></p>
