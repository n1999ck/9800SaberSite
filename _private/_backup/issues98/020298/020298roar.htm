        <p><img src="../oldimages/Roar_Column.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="300" height="246"><font size="4"><strong> I would like to say a few words about
        this school. I love CSU very much and I only wish the
        best for the University. However I would like to point
        out a concern. I hear many students that are frustrated
        because of the lack of support from their professors. It
        seems that some professors feel that students are here
        only for an education, period. That seems to be a very
        cold attitude towards the students and life. Sure life is
        cold sometimes, but if that is ones way of living then my
        frigid friend, you chose the wrong path in life. Maybe
        that professor should have picked a career where hope and
        happiness could be far from them.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Shouldn&#146;t college be a way
        of expanding your mind as well as your state of being?
        Why do some professors become upset and resentful when
        the students have an event the sometimes interferes with
        their class? I totally support going to class on time and
        consecutively, but when the SPC, Greeks, SGA, or any
        other organization plans an event, professors sometimes
        refuse any leniency what-so-ever. Have we become so
        dis-attached to the students that we don&#146;t remember
        when we are in college? There is a time and a place for
        work, and a time for &#147;School Spirit&#148;. It seems
        that we don&#146;t have much school spirit. I really
        enjoyed the talent show the other night, but did you
        notice that their were only three or four faculty and
        staff members present? I think that they were asked to
        judge. It&#146;s a shame to me. I love this school and I
        would hate to see it to just fade into just another place
        to get a degree. Now I realize that the problem is not
        with all the instructors, there are students who have
        other things to attend to like work; but it would be so
        much more enjoyable to teach a student that is happy to
        be here. These organizations are trying desperately to
        get things started on this campus for everyone to enjoy.
        So please lets work together to make this a school
        that&#146;s fun to attend and educational; not just a job
        and a classroom. Let&#146;s get to know each other as
        people that have something to offer each other.
        That&#146;s where the learning begins...</strong></font></p>
