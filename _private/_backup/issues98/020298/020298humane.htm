        <td><font size="4">Do you own one of those critters that
        has been man&#146;s best friend since the beginning of
        time? Do you pamper and spoil him just a little? If you
        do, your animal is one lucky pet. There are many homeless
        animals packed away in shelters. One hundred-thirty seven
        of them are housed at the Muscogee County Humane Society
        right here in Columbus off Schatulga Road, founded by
        Colonel Sydney Sacerdote in 1973.</font><p><font size="4">The
        Muscogee County Humane Society is launching an awareness
        and fundraising campaign in the Greater Columbus area to <img src="020298kitten2.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="246" height="214"></font><font size="4">make
        people aware of the identity and needs of the Society and
        their animals as well as to help support our area&#146;s
        homeless animals housed at the shelter. Their facility is
        in dire need of renovation and expansion. The number of
        homeless pets is growing - but unfortunately the
        facilities and therefore accommodation possibilities at
        the Society are not. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Upkeep of the animals as well as
        expansion and renovation of facilities are crucial
        issues. At this time, the Muscogee County Humane Society
        can only house 137 animals at a time. From January 1997
        to the end of October 1997 almost 2,000 animals passed
        through the Society&#146;s doors. They were able to find
        homes for 657 of them. Sadly, the rest had to be
        destroyed because of insufficient room and insufficient
        funds to carry and provide for the animals for a longer
        period of time. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><img src="2298dog.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="211" height="300"></font><font size="4">The Society takes in homeless animals from
        Muscogee, Talbot, Meriwether, Harris, Taylor, Lee, and
        Russell Counties, as well as from Phenix City. Contrary
        to popular belief, the Society does not receive funding
        from the State of Georgia nor the City of Columbus. They
        are not associated with the Columbus Dog Pound. The
        Humane Society solely relies on volunteers and private or
        company contributions from the greater Columbus
        area&#146;s animal lovers. They are barely breaking even
        at this time and could use YOUR help in getting
        improvements underway.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The big question: What can you do to
        help? The answer is: A lot of different things: You, your
        fraternity, sorority, association, honor society, or any
        other organization you may belong to could help in
        several different ways: </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">1. Actively promote neutering and
        spaying of animals with family and friends to cut down on
        the animal overpopulation.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">2. Promote adoptions of pets from the
        Muscogee County Humane Society with family and friends or
        anyone you know who is considering to enrich their lives
        with a pet. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">3. Shop at the Humane Society Thrift
        Shop. They have everything from dishes to clothes to
        furniture and electronics. You can offer your support by
        buying from them instead of other stores.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">4. Hold fundraisers such as car-washes,
        yard sales, raffles, bake sales, recycling campaigns and
        donate the proceeds to the Humane Society. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">5. Place Human Society donation banks
        around town and pledge to maintain them. <img src="2298kitten.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="200" height="270"></font></p>
        <p><font size="4">6. Volunteer your time at one of the
        special events the Humane Society holds throughout the
        year.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">7. Donate unwanted items that may be
        hidden in your closets, cupboards and sheds at home to
        the Humane Society Thrift Shop for resale. (multi-purpose
        cleaners, bleach, rags, old newspapers, etc.) </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">8. Donate towels (all sizes), blankets,
        food bowls, pet toys, pet carriers, pet food. They can
        even use empty toilet paper roles for the animals to play
        with. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">9. Become sponsors or even members of
        the Muscogee County Humane Society and bless the animals
        with monthly pledges. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">10. Make a one time contribution only.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Take your pick - the Muscogee County
        Humane Society appreciates any help you can provide <img src="020298kitten3.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="242" height="165"></font><font size="4">them
        with.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">Please, be &#147;a voice
        for those who cannot speak&#148;. Help the Humane Society
        succeed in making Columbus a better place to live for our
        homeless, four-legged friends. If you would like to
        volunteer your services, have questions or want more
