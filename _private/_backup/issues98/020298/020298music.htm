        <td><font size="4">The American Music Awards took place
        last week. Babyface claimed the Best Male Artist prize,
        with Celine Dion taking the award for Best Female Artist.
        The Best Alternative act went to Bush. </font><p><font size="4">As if we didn&#146;t have enough scandal going
        on already, Bret Micheals and Pamela Anderson Lee are
        causing some more. The Poison frontman is going to court
        this week to try to put a stop to the release of a sex
        video of himself and Pamela Anderson Lee. <br>
        A copy of the video is in the hands of an organization
        called the Internet Entertainment Group, and they plan on
        releasing it to the public as early as this week.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">IEG claims to have retrieved the copy
        from a friend of Bret Micheals, but they are not giving
        out any names. Micheals claims that the only other copy
        other than the one he has is owned by Pamela Anderson
        Lee.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Micheals has spent nearly $100,000 so
        far to keep the tape off the market, and threatens to sue
        IEG for $90,000,000 in damages, if they release the tape.
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">A sex video of Pamela Anderson Lee and
        Motley Crue drummer, Tommy Lee, has grossed over
        $1,000,000 on the home video market and internet. In the
        midst of this court battle, Poison will go back into the
        studio to record a new album this spring. Vocalist Bret
        Micheals, bassist Bobby Dall, and drummer Rikki Rocket
        will be joined once again by original guitar player C.C.
        Deville.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Matt Cameron, former drummer for
        Soundgarden, has recorded seven new songs with the
        Smashing Pumpkins. Cameron recently told fans on an
        internet chat that , &#147;I have no plans of joining the
        Smashing Pumpkins.&#148; <br>
        He says the recordings were just on a friendly basis and
        he has no idea which ones or if any will show up on the
        next Smashing Pumpkins album. He went on to announce
        plans to complete second albums with both his side
        projects, Wellwater Conspiracy and Hater. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Oasis has made it three weeks into
        there United States tour with virtually no fighting or
        arguing between the two Gallagher brothers. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">According to fans that recently
        attended shows, Liam Gallagher has been joking and
        playing with both the crowds and his bandmates. After
        closing the show in San Francisco with a ten minute
        version of the song &#147;Champaign Supernova,&#148; Noel
        Gallagher told fans, &#147;Thanks for listening.&#148; </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Oasis will perform at the Fox Theater
        in Atlanta on February 8.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">KMFDM looks to be the only big release
        this week, with there remix versions of Megalomaniac. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">If you are looking for new music to
        listen to that is already in stores you might want to
        check out a band called Babybird. Fans of the band U2
        should enjoy Babybird, because there album &#147;Ugly
        Beautiful&#148; is very much in the U2 style of music.
        Another excellent new album is &#147;Monsoon&#148; by
        Caroline&#146;s Spine. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Everclear has announced that they may
        be adding a Spring tour to there already year long tour.
        I highly recommend catching their show if at all
        possible. Everclear performed at the Cotton Club in
        Atlanta several months ago, and showcased their new
        album, &#147;So Much For The Afterglow&#148; flawlessly. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">On the local front, LeAnn Rimes will be
        performing at the Civic Center here in Columbus on
        February 7. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Pearl Jam fans take note: On Monday
        February 2 at 11:45, local music store Riff&#146;s will
        re-open for a midnight sale of Pearl Jam&#146;s new
        album, &#147;Yield&#148;. Riff&#146;s is located on 2723
        Manchester Expressway. </font></p>
