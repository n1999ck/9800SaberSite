        at CSU on February 5, in the Fine Arts Hall auditorium at
        12:30 p.m. The event, which is part of CSU&#146;s Black
        History Month celebration, is free and open to the
        public.</font><p><font size="4">Best known as the
        principle with the bullhorn and a baseball bat, Clark
        turned a troubled inner city high school into an
        institution of serious learning and immeasurable pride. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">In September 1981, on the first day of
        classes at Eastside High, in Paterson, New Jersey, a
        student was stabbed. By 1982, Clark transformed the
        school into a model learning environment.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Clark&#146;s disciplinary actions and
        determination earned him national recognition. He was
        named a model educator by President Reagan and was
        offered a White House post.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Clark held high expectations for his
        students, and challenged them to develop habits for
        success. During his first week at Eastside High, Clark
        expelled 300 students for vandalism, fighting, drug
        possession, profanity or abusing teachers. Clark says,
        &#147;If there is no discipline, no learning can take
        place. Without discipline there is anarchy. Good
        citizenship demands attention to responsibilities as well
        as rights.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">&#147;60 Minutes,&#148;
        &#147;Night-line&#148; and &#147;Donahue&#148; profiled
        Clark and his story was portrayed in the motion picture
        &#147;Lean on Me,&#148; starring Morgan Freeman. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">While attending high school Clark
        worked to help support his mother, brother and sisters.
        He received a BA from William Patterson College and
        received his master&#146;s degree at Seton Hall
        University.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Today, Joe Clark is Director of Essex
        County Youth House, a juvenile detention center in
        Newark, New Jersey.</font></p>
