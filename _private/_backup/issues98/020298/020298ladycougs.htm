        <td><font size="4">If anyone questioned the championship
        mentality of the Columbus State women&#146;s basketball
        team, one need not look further than what transpired
        recently between Atlanta and Columbus.</font><p><font size="4">The Lady Cougars dominance this season continued
        as Columbus took an 89-81 homecoming victory over the
        defending Peach Belt champions, Kennesaw State. Columbus
        used superior speed and skill to outplay a team that
        boasted some of the tallest players in the conference.
        CSU saw a 12-point lead dissappear but the Lady Cougars
        kept fighting and eventually took the lead back and
        coasted to victory. In the win, Columbus set two new
        school records. Going 38-45 at the free-throw line, the
        Lady Cougars broke the school record for free-throws made
        in a game and tied the record for free-throws attempted
        in a game. The win over Kennesaw only began the saga for
        the Lady Cougars. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">After the win over Kennesaw, Columbus
        State, with a 14-3 record, traveled to Atlanta to face
        non-conference Morris Brown. In the game, the Lady
        Cougars found themselves not only down in score but
        facing major controversy as well. During the game Que
        Gilliam was benched after a flagrant foul and had to be
        disciplined by head coach Jay Sparks for her actions on
        the sideline. The Lady Cougars could not get their game
        on track and eventually were upset by the Wolverettes
        86-81. For many teams who are used to success, an upset
        loss marred by controversy usually starts a downhill
        spiral that ends with great disappointment. The Lady
        Cougars proved, however, that they are not like most
        teams.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">With Gilliam sidelined for the entire
        first half for her actions against Morris Brown, Columbus
        State rebounded from it&#146;s loss to destroy the
        USC-Spartanburg Lady Rifles 104-49 at Woodruff Gym. The
        55-point win broke the Peach Belt Conference record for
        largest margin of victory. The Lady Cougars used a
        vicious full-court press to hold the Lady Rifles to a
        meager 17 points at halftime. Gilliam came off the bench
        in the second half to lead the Lady Cougars with 15
        points. Center Carrie Long and forward Tocshia Campfield
        each added 11 points. The defensive press that Columbus
        State applied produced 38 Lady Rifle turnovers, 28 of
        those on steals. The victory enabled the Lady Cougars to
        stay perfect in the Peach Belt Conference at 9-0, and
        raise their overall record to 15-4. </font></p>
