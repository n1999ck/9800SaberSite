        <td><font size="4">Desperate Measures, a Mandalay
        Entertainment film starring Michael Keaton, Andy Garcia,
        Marcia Gay Harden and Brian Cox, was released on January
        30 by TriStar Pictures.</font><p><font size="4">Desperate
        Measures is about two men with diametrically opposed
        agendas who clash in a struggle that is literally about
        life and death. Frank Connor (played by Andy Garcia) is a
        San Francisco police officer who lives to uphold the law,
        but who is suddenly forced to go to increasingly
        desperate lengths to find a compatible bone marrow donor
        for his gravely ill son, Matt. Peter McCabe (played by
        Michael Keaton, in a bold dramatic departure) is the
        boy&#146;s perfect DNA match. He is also a homicidal
        sociopath serving a life sentence in a maximum security
        prison.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><img src="020298desp.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="290" height="195"></font><font size="4">After Connor convinces his superiors to
        transport McCabe to the hospital where Matt&#146;s
        transplant can be performed, the killer seizes the
        opportunity to stage an ingenious escape, leaving a trail
        of wounded and dead in his wake. When police
        reinforcements are called in, the hospital becomes a
        battleground and Connor, who under any other
        circumstances would pursue McCabe and shoot him on sight,
        now has the opposite goal: defying, and perhaps
        endangering, his fellow officers, he must do everything
        he can to find McCabe and keep him alive. For if McCabe
        dies, his bone marrow is useless, and Matt dies as well. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">As these two men take increasingly
        daring measures to achieve their ends, they ensnare
        others into their game of cat and mouse: Captain Jeremiah
        Cassidy (Cox), Connor&#146;s superior officer, who
        initially acts out of loyalty to Connor but who lives to
        regret it following McCabe&#146;s bloody escape; Dr.
        Samantha Hawkins (Harden), Matt&#146;s physician, who
        struggles with the fact that her unwavering commitment to
        her young patient&#146;s survival comes at such an awful
        cost; and, most importantly, Matt Connor himself (played
        by newcomer Joseph Cross), whose only hope lies with a
        desperate fugitive who may be deadly to everyone else,
        but who represents life itself to Matt. It is this
        strangely mature child facing his own mortality who lies
        at the center of the drama , poised between two
        antagonists who hold his fate in their hands.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">As McCabe continues to elude his
        captors, Desparate Measures reveals itself to be about
        much more then relentless pursuit. For as Connor
        splinters off from his colleges and abandons the code by
        which he has lived, his moral sense grows closer and
        closer to McCabe&#146;s; in very different ways, both men
        share a single-minded dedication to survival at any
        price. In fact, all of the films characters ultimately
        face the same unique dilemma: each of them does what he
        or she must, gradually realizing that the consequences of
        their actions are far from clear cut and hold as much
        potential for harm as for good.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Desparate Measures, which was filmed on
        location in San Francisco and in and around Los Angeles,
        is produced by Schroeder and his longtime collaborator
        and producing partner Susan Hoffman, along with Gary
        Foster (Tin Cup) and Lee Rich (Just Cause). Jeffrey
        Chernov (First Kid) is executive producer and the
        screenplay is by David Klass (Kiss the Girls). Returning
        with Schroeder are Director of Photography Luciano Tovoli
        and Editor Lee Percy, who have worked with the director
        on his last four projects. Geoffrey Kirkland (Mississippi
        Burning) is the production designer and Gary Jones (Just
        Cause) is the costume designer. </font></p>
