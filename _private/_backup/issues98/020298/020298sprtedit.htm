        <td><font size="4">Throughout my days here at Columbus
        State I have had the pleasure of attending many a
        sporting event on campus. Although fun and entertaining,
        I was always bothered by the lack of support shown by the
        student body at these games. The trend has continued this
        year as only a handful of students attend basketball
        games. Even when they do occupy Woodruff Gym, they tend
        to sit quietly and watch the game, cheering only for a
        monster slam-dunk or an arm-breaking rejection.</font><p><font size="4">At the recent homecoming game against Kennesaw
        State, I finally got to see what I&#146;ve been waiting
        for: someone to get obnoxious. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The members of the Sigma Nu fraternity
        brought to Woodruff Gym many of the sights and sounds of
        a large university sporting event. With members decked
        out in traditional shirt and tie and hovering around a
        grill at a tailgate party, it almost seemed to bring the
        same pre-game atmosphere one would find at a University
        of Georgia or Auburn football game. During the games, the
        members of Sigma Nu made their presence known in a big
        way with their bead filled aluminum cans. The Sigma Nu
        members got so loud at one point during the men&#146;s
        game that the Kennesaw State coach protested to the
        referee. After being asked to not use the artificial
        noise makers, the Sigma Nu members migrated across the
        court and sat directly behind the Kennesaw bench where
        they used their natural noise makers to throw taunts and
        insults at the rival Owls. I don&#146;t know how much of
        an affect the loud cheering had on the game, but when an
        opposing team walks over to their bench and has their
        attention focused on the crowd, it&#146;s bound to have
        some impact.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Now I&#146;m not promoting the use of
        artificial noise makers, they are against NCAA rules, but
        the school spirit shown by these students was classic.
        The kind of cheering section formed by Sigma Nu at the
        game was on a smaller scale to the &#147;Cameron
        Crazies&#148; at Duke or the &#147;Cliff Dwellers&#148;
        at Auburn. It was obvious that these men were genuinely
        having fun cheering on the Cougars and taunting the
        opponent. It&#146;s really ashamed that more students and
        student organizations won&#146;t pull together to support
        the teams here at CSU. One thing is for sure, the Sigma
        Nu fraternity did a stand up job at the Kennesaw State
        game supporting the team and more groups need to follow
        their example in the future.</font></p>
