        Zeppelin fans will be happy to know that the new album by
        Robert Pant and Jimmy Page is scheduled for release on
        April 21. &#147;Walking Into Clarksdale&#148; is the
        first new studio material the duo has recorded since Led
        Zeppelin&#146;s 1979 &#147;In Through The Out Door.&#148;
        </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Page and Plant
        recently wrapped up recording at Abbey Road Studios in
        London. The track listing for &#147;Walking Into
        Clarksdale&#148; is as follows: &#147;Shining in the
        Light&#148;, &#147;When the World Was Young&#148;,
        &#147;Upon A Golden Horse&#148;, &#147;Blue Train&#148;,
        &#147;Please Read the Letter&#148;, &#147;Most
        High&#148;, &#147;Heart in Your Mind&#148;, &#147;Walking
        Into Clarksdale&#148;, &#147;Burning Up&#148;, &#147;When
        I was a Child&#148;, &#147;House of Love&#148;, and
        &#147;Sons of Freedom&#148;. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The first single from the album
        is &#147;Most High&#148;. The standout track is
        &#147;Please Read the Letter&#148;, which boasts heavy
        guitar from Page and pleading vocals from Plant. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>For those who think new
        material by the Led Zeppelin duo is just too much to
        handle right now, &#147;Elmopalooza&#148; is coming soon!
        Rock meets Sesame Street on this special compilation that
        is due to hit stores in April. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The album pairs Jimmy Buffett
        with Kermit the Frog, Shawn Colvin with Ernie, Gloria
        Estefan with Rosita and the Oinker Sisters, The Mighty
        Mighty Bosstones with The Count, Rosie O&#146;Donnell and
        Elmo, and Celine Dion with Herry Monster. Other guests on
        the album include Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, Kenny
        Loggins, En Vogue, Fugees, and Big Bird. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Fans of the band Soul Asylum
        can track the progress of the making of their new
        album,&#148;Candy From A Stranger&#148; through the bands
        website. The address is www.soulasylum.com. The website
        showcases many pictures of the band at work and the
        finished product will available in late April.
        &#147;Candy From A Stranger&#148; will also include
        CD-Rom compatible footage of the band.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Presidents of the United States
        of America will release their final album on March 10.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The now defunct band is
        releasing &#147;Pure Frosting&#148;, a compilation of
        rarities and b-sides, plus three new songs. March 10 also
        brings new albums from Eric Clapton, Ben Harper, Natalie
        Imbruglia, and Spacehog. The Natalie Imbruglia album,
        &#147;Left of the Middle&#148;, is excellent and sure to
        be a huge success.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Scott Weiland, frontman for the
        band Stone Temple Pilots, debuts with his first solo
        album on March17. The album, &#147;12 Bar Blues&#148;,
        features special guests Peter DiStefano of Porno For
        Pyros and Sheryl Crow on the accordion. This effort by
        Weiland is better than anything that Stone Temple Pilots
        has done as of yet. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>If you are interested in a new
        band, I think I&#146;ve found a winner. The band is
        called Closer, and the album is called &#147;Don&#146;t
        Walk&#148;. Closer is Harley DiNardo, Derrek Hawkins,
        Dave Cartategui, and Jonathan Nanberg. The band is
        currently on Revolution Records and are potential
        superstars. &#147;Don&#146;t Walk&#148; is full of
        potential hit singles and this album will not disappoint.
        Closer is comparable to the sounds of Oasis and The Verve
        Pipe, but with their own spin and better lyrics.</strong></font></p>
