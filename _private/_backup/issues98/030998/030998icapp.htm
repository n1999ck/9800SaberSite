    <td><font size="4"><strong>Vice President Al Gore said in a speech Monday that he agrees
    with a Columbus State University (CSU) student who called Georgia&#146;s Intellectual
    Capital Partnership Program (ICAPP) an &#147;excuse eradicator&#148;.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong><img src="030998goregirl.jpg" align="left" hspace="0" width="265" height="250">The largest single business investment in the South East, ICAPP, helps
    educate people in computer based knowledge to provide local companies the high tech
    employees needed to run their companies. </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>CSU is the designer and first implementer of ICAPP in Georgia.
    According to an ICAPP brochure, the aim is to help Georgia business and industry acquire a
    well-educated employment pool. </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>CSU&#146;s program began as a partnership with Total System
    Services, Inc. Now, other Georgia companies are using the program.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>The program works due to business collaboration. A company meets
    an individual and agrees to sponsor them until graduation. The company agrees to hire the
    student after graduation from the ICAPP program. </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>The program is a collaboration among CSU, private industry, the
    University System of Georgia and the State of Georgia to increase availability of high
    tech education, according to an ICAPP brochure. </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>It began when Total System Services of Georgia experienced a
    shortage of computer programmers. CSU, along with the Georgia Department of Industry and
    Trade and the Columbus Chamber of Commerce, repackaged seven of its computer science
    courses to meet TSYS&#146; educational needs. This program was funded in part by
    Georgia&#146;s Quickstart and was called the COMPASS Program. </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>In 1992, an agreement reached among CSU, TSYS, and IBM, resulted
    in a first-of-its-kind applied computer science curriculum developed by CSU.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>In the Winter of 1994, CSU and TSYS undertook their largest
    cooperative education program to date,called Quickstart 2. Quickstart 2 continued into
    1996. By the end of this time, CSU had educated more than 550 computer professionals. </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>In March 1996, Georgia Governor Zell Miller escalated the
    collaboration between CSU and TSYS and called it ICAPP. The ICAPP program has become a
    model for economic development efforts in Georgia. This landmark initiative made it
    possible for CSU to provide the facilities, equipment, and personnel to educate 400
    computer professionals a year. </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>A student that has a sponsor can receive a service cancelable
    loan. The loan is to help with living costs and extra educational fees. After the
    individual works at a computer related job for any Georgia company in the state for four
    years the loan is canceled.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>According to an ICAPP brochure, by the end of 1998, CSU will
    have educated approximately 1200 computer professionals. </strong></font></td>
