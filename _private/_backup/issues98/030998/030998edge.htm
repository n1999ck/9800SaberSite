        <td><font size="4"><strong>Administrations of every
        successful university attempt to attract sharp and
        motivated students. They also work to keep the students
        at their university. CSU, preparing for semester
        conversion, is offering some special perks to make the
        students want to come to CSU and stay at CSU. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong><img src="030998edge.jpg" align="right" hspace="0" width="300" height="300"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>To keep the competitive edge with other
        universities in the Southeast CSU announces the Honors
        Program to start Fall semester 1998. The program will
        provide significant challenges and opportunities to
        enrich an exceptional student&#146;s education and will
        take educational experience beyond the ordinary. It will
        strive to create a community of outstanding scholars as
        well as to stimulate involvement in campus and community
        activities. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The Honors Program was designed
        to challenge and reward highly motivated students with
        special intellectual, cultural, and social opportunities.
        Activities in and out of the classroom will offer a
        breadth of perspective and depth of understanding
        specifically tailored for Honor students. The Program
        will offer friendships and camaraderie by providing
        opportunities for students to participate in a variety of
        enrichment activities.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Honors courses will not involve
        any more work or time than regular courses but a
        different kind of work. Generally, they will involve more
        independent study, more stimulating and imaginative
        assignments, more experiential learning, and greater
        opportunities to utilize and develop writing, critical
        thinking and computer skills.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Because honors classes will be
        small, students will receive more individual attention
        from their professors than do students in regular
        classes. Honors professors will get to know their
        students well, take pride in nurturing their abilities
        and will be ideally suited to write effective letters of
        recommendation for the student&#146;s career placement. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Students in the Honors Program
        will take 3 honors courses that substitute for core
        curriculum courses. These and most honors courses will
        have an H designator following the course number or be
        listed as an HONS course. These courses, limited to 15
        students per course, will be designed to encourage
        discussion, independent work, critical and reflective
        thinking, and significant writing, creative or computer
        projects. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Several honors core courses
        will be taught each semester. Courses offered in Fall
        1998 are Principles of Biology ,Art Appreciation and
        Pre-Calculus. Courses offered for Spring 1999 are
        Freshmen Composition, American Government, and
        Communications.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Each student enrolled will take
        a minimum of 9 upper-division semester hours (exclusive
        internships and cooperative programs) in the major or
        related area as designed by colleges in cooperation with
        departments. The maximum number of independent study
        semester hours within the Honors Program is 3. Generally,
        upper division honors courses will encourage more
        advanced work or allow for greater creativity.
        Flexibility will be allowed in programs. The Honors
        Program Committee must approve program designs.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Each student enrolled will also
        engage in an off-campus enrichment activity such as a
        service program (for example, CSU Ambassadors), a service
        learning program, study abroad, or other significant
        experience. Students need to submit proposals to the
        Honors Program Committee for approval and sign up for
        HONS 2000, a non-credit course.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Furthermore, each enrolled
        student will participate in four specified honors events,
        one per semester for four semesters. To fulfill this
        obligation, students will sign up for HONS 3000, a
        non-credit class, and submit critical evaluations of
        events to the Associate Dean of University College. The
        general education learning outcomes for HONS 3000 will
        vary because the events will vary. Most events will
        emphasize contemporary phenomena, aesthetics, critical
        thinking and communication.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The thesis and oral defense are
        capstones of the Honors Program. Topics need to be
        approved within the student&#146;s major department. An
        appropriately chosen college committee will hear the oral
        defense. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>To earn credit of the thesis
        and defense, students need to sign up for HONS 4000
        (3-0-3). The general education learning outcomes are
        Communications, Critical Thinking, and others, depending
        on major. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Under special circumstances,
        the Honors Program Committee will consider an
        alternative, equivalent activity to the thesis and
        defense.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>There will be a special
        luncheon held for honors students every semester. The
        luncheon will include a guest speaker. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Transcripts of honors students
        will include the designation &#147;Graduated from Honors
        Program&#148;and special recognition will be given at
        graduation to honors students. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>There will be a ceremony and
        banquet prior to graduation, special access to
        distinguished visitors to campus, extra-curricular
        activities such as social and cultural events, waiver of
        out-of-state tuition (limited number available), paid
        books, early registration before all other students and
        smaller classes (15 students per class) for students
        participating in the program. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>There are currently 10 honors
        scholarships available, sponsored by the Columbus
        Foundation. These scholarships are in addition to the
        HOPE scholarships. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Currently, the Honors
        scholarship pays the student $3,300/year. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The amount varies from year to
        year and is expected to go even higher within the next 1
        to 2 years. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The scholarship is at this time
        still reserved for students right out of high school, but
        changes are in the works to also accommodate Freshmen and
        Sophomores. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Enrolled students will also
        have to opportunity to study abroad. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>They will spend approximately 5
        to 6 weeks in a foreign country such as France or England
        to learn about the country&#146;s culture and people.
        Initially, these trips will be partially offset by the
        CSU foundation but eventually will be fully paid for the
        students on the Honors scholarships. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Plans to raise the number of
        available Honors scholarships to 20 instead of ten are in
        the works.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>In certain cases, the Honors
        Program Committee may consider exceptions to the
        admission criteria. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Once a student is admitted to
        the Honors Program, he must enroll in a minimum of 9
        semester hours per semester and must maintain a 3.50
        cumulative GPA. If the student&#146;s cumulative GPA
        falls below 3.50, the student will be placed on probation
        for one semester but can continue to take honors courses.
        </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>If the student&#146;s
        cumulative GPA is below 3.50 at the end of the
        probationary semester, the student will be suspended from
        the Honors Program but may reapply to enter the Program
        if his/her cumulative GPA returns to 3.50 or higher.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Students may not enter the
        program while enrolled in developmental studies courses
        or in courses to remediate CPC deficiencies.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Students not in the Honors
        Program may enroll in honors courses, space permitting
        during regular registration, so long as they have a
        minimum cumulative GPA of 3.50.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>If interested in participating
        in this program contact Dr. Barbara J. Hunt. Hunt can be
        reached through e-mail, by phone at 568-2054 or at her
        office Richards 319 until the end of March when her
        office will move to Arnold 126. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>There will only be 45 slots
        available for fall of 1998.</strong></font></p>
