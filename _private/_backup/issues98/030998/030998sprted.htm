        <td><font size="4"><strong>The world of sports recently
        lost one of it&#146;s greatest icons and I lost a hero.
        No, this person couldn&#146;t slam dunk a basketball or
        hit towering home-runs. He couldn&#146;t dart through a
        vicious defensive line like a burst of electricity. What
        this man could do though was get the attention of
        millions nearly every single day during a baseball
        season. This man was Harry Caray. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Caray was the type of individual who was
        known by people who never even watched a Chicago Cubs
        baseball game. Nearly every living soul who has ever
        heard of the game of baseball in the United States knew
        who Caray was. For those unfortunate few who didn&#146;t
        know his name, they too even knew of the raspy voiced
        announcer with the thick black glasses who could grab the
        attention of millions with his rendition of &#147;Take Me
        Out To The Ballgame&#148; at every Cubs home game. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>For me, Harry Caray was more
        than just an announcer. He was baseball. For as long as I
        can remember, I&#146;ve enjoyed watching the Chicago Cubs
        play, not for the great players like Ryan Sandberg or
        Mark Grace, but to hear the passion and excitement of
        Caray&#146;s broadcasting skills. He could take a simple
        grounder or pop fly and add just enough pizazz to it to
        make it exciting. His trademark exclamation of Holy Cow
        is what most will remember him for. One of his other
        greatest exclamations is one that I would always imitate
        while playing baseball. When the wood of the bat cracked
        with power and the ball went soaring into the air, Caray
        would proclaim, &#147;It could be, It might be, IT IS! as
        the ball disappeared over the wall.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>As a hopeful sports
        broadcaster, I always viewed Caray&#146;s ability to call
        a game as an inspiration. His ability to bring excitement
        to a game was something to be treasured. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Yes, Harry Caray was a baseball
        icon and he will be truly missed. Hopefully, ol&#146;
        Harry is up there in baseball heaven watching over his
        beloved Cubs, sipping on his favorite beverage, beer, and
        exclaiming,&#148;HOLY COW&#148; for every remarkable play
        made by anyone wearing the red and blue of the Chicago
        Cubs.</strong></font></p>
