        Cougars Softball team recently swept a double header from
        West Georgia in a game held at CSU.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>In the first game, Columbus gave up
        three quick runs in the first inning, but that was all
        West Georgia could manage. The Lady Cougars scored four
        runs in the fourth inning to take a 6-3 advantage and
        added a seventh run in the fifth inning. CSU was led by
        Britnie Wysong who went 2-4 at the plate and had 2
        RBI&#146;s, and Nathalie Fradette who went 2-3. Carrie
        Newton recorded her fourth win of the early season to run
        her record to 4-0.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The second game saw last
        year&#146;s Freshman of the Year dominate West Georgia
        from the pitching circle. After coming off of her 2-3
        performance at the plate in the opening game, Fradette
        continued to be impressive as she pitched a two hitter
        and gave up only one run in a 7-1 Lady Cougar route. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>After the two teams went
        scoreless through the first two innings, CSU exploded for
        four runs in the third, one in the fifth, and two more
        runs in the sixth to cushion their lead. CSU was led at
        the plate by Merri Anne McCall who went 2-4 with 3
        RBI&#146;s and Kelly Murdock who went 2-3 with an RBI.
        With her victory, Fradette ran her record to 3-1 on the
        season.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Columbus raised their record to
        3-1 for the season and prepare to travel to Valdosta,
        Georgia for the Valdosta State Univ. Tournament to be
        held March 6-8. The Lady Cougars next home game will be
        on March 13 when SIU-Edwardsville pays a visit to CSU.</strong></font></p>
