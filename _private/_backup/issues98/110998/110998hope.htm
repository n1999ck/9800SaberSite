            <tr>
                <td bgcolor="#000000"><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Many questions seem to
                arise when the words &#148;financial aid&#148;
                are mentioned. One area that happens to create so
                much controversy is the H.O.P.E. scholarship and
                the eligibility constraints on this form of
                federal aid. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Questions
                that students may ask include, &#147;What grade
                point average must I have?&#148; &#147;How long
                will it last?&#148; or &#147;How am I penalized
                if I drop or fail a class?&#148; These are just a
                few of the questions raised by students. Director
                of Financial Aid, Mr. Al Pinckney, was able to
                provide some answers to these questions.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">To be
                eligible for the H.O.P.E. scholarship as an
                undergraduate, you must fit into one of the
                following three categories. You must receive
                H.O.P.E. as a high school graduate, have a
                cumulative 3.0 GPA at 30 attempted semester
                hours, or have a cumulative 3.0 GPA at 60
                attempted semester hours. A very important point
                to remember is that you must be a Georgia
                resident in order to receive H.O.P.E. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">However,
                some students who receive an out-of-state fee
                waiver may qualify and should contact the
                financial aid office for specific requirements.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Mr.
                Pinckney pointed out that sometimes students don&#146;t
                realize that all credit hours that they have
                attempted since completing high school will count
                in determining their eligibility for H.O.P.E.
                That means courses that were passed, failed,
                incomplete, or withdrawn from after the first day
                will be counted toward the maximum time limit for
                receiving the scholarship. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Mr.
                Pinckney suggests that students check with their
                academic advisor and the financial aid office
                before making a withdrawal decision.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">There
                are check points to determine your continued
                eligibility. If a student has a 3.0 GPA at the
                30th, 60th and 90th attempted semester hours,
                they will be able to receive the scholarship up
                to a maximum of 127 semester hours. Eligibility
                will be terminated if a 3.0 GPA is not obtained
                at the end of 30 semester hours for recipients
                out of high school. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">However,
                a student does have a second chance to regain the
                scholarship at the end of 60 semester hours only.
                </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">The
                H.O.P.E. scholarship is a great asset to any
                student because it covers any actual tuition
                charges and mandatory fees charged to all
                students that are not covered by the Federal Pell
                Grant or Supplemental Educational Opportunity
                Grant. Students enrolled in six or more hours
                will receive a $150 book allowance and those
                enrolled in five credit hours or less receive a
                $75 book allowance. There is no minimum number of
                hours per term of enrollment required for
                eligibility.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">&#147;We
                are receiving a machine that will allow students
                to fill out their FAFSA forms electronically for
                quicker submission and we hope to have this
                machine up and running next Fall,&#148; Pinckney
                stated. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">The
                office has undergone some changes and they now
                offer a &#147;counselor of the day&#148; to help
                students with any questions they may have. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Pinckney
                added, &#148;We experienced some rough waters in
                the fall, but we are looking for smoother sailing
                in the spring.&#148;</font></p>
