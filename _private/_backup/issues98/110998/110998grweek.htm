                Breemes of Kappa Sigma and Amanda Branson of
                Delta Zeta. The Banner competition was won by
                Delta Zeta and Xi Theta was given the

                Week was &#147;an opportunity for all Greek
                organizations to come together once a year and
                show support for one another and try to get the
                message out to non-Greeks as to what we are all
                about.&#148;</font></p>
