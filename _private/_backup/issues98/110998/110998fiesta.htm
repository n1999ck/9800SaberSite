                the International Network sponsored a Hispanic
                Fiesta in the Davidson Cafeteria that consisted
                of a guest speaker, dinner, and entertainment.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Members
                of the group, who often sponsor various ethnic
                events, hosted the event at no cost to those who
                attended. The event&#146;s purpose was to
                celebrate Hispanic culture.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Members
                of the International Network and the Hispanic
                community performed dances and wore authentic
                outfits that represented 13 Hispanic countries.
                Some of the countries represented were Brazil,
                Colombia, and Mexico.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">The
                Network invited Dr. Raymond Gonzalez, professor
                of political science at CSU, to speak about
                Hispanics in the United States. He spoke about
                the political influence of Hispanics in the
                country.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Gonzalez
                stated that while Hispanics make up about 10
                percent of the country, many do not vote.
                Gonzalez also claimed that although many do not
                vote, many Hispanics involved in politics do well
                when they run for state and local offices.
                Gonzalez expressed the importance of voting among
                all Americans and encouraged everyone to vote.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">The
                food provided an opportunity to experience
                different tastes from around the world. Although
                the event was dedicated to Hispanic culture, a
                buffet was provided by members of the Network
                that included food from other countries, such as
                China and Japan.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">In
                her closing remarks, Merlina Salamanca, Executive
                Director of the Network and a native of the
                Philippines, expressed the importance of becoming
                a member of the Network. She said that the group
                provides an opportunity for members to gain new
                friends and experience different cultural
                activities.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">The
                Network is a non-profit organization that began
                in 1995. The group sponsors other events such as
                the Asian Pacific Celebration, the International
                Picnic for the Japanese Exchange Students, and
                monthly cultural presentations.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">The
                main goals of the group are to enhance cultural
                awareness, support improvements in education, and
                to promote fellowship through social activities
                for the members, their families, and friends.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">The
                International Network is hosting a similar event,
                Polynesian Night, on Saturday, November 14.</font></p>
