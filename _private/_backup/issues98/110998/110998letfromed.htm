                <td bgcolor="#000000"><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Class availability has
                become a major problem with many CSU students.
                However, many of the students are those who are
                approaching graduation and need certain classes
                to graduate.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">What
                students need to realize is that the semester
                conversion is a new transition for the faculty as
                well. What some students do not realize is the
                fact that some faculty are trying to help
                students in the best way possible.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">I am
                one of those students who is experiencing the
                same problem. But, the department I am associated
                with is helping students in the best way
                possible. The faculty and staff of the
                Communication Department are helping students in
                many ways due to the controversial semester
                conversion.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">A
                more structured approach is being taken to allow
                for more time with students. This is just one of
                the many departments taking the initiative to
                help more students with their registration
                headaches.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Instead
                of getting stressed out over what classes to
                take, ask your advisor to take the time to help
                you manage your class schedule. The process is
                grueling, but adjustments are being made and help
                is being offered for students with class
                availability problems.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">With
                cooperation between the faculty and student body
                at CSU, the problem of class availability will
                hopefully be a small problem in the future.</font></p>
