            <tr>
                <td bgcolor="#000000"><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">What is it like to attend
                an SEC football game? Well, let&#146;s just say
                that there is nothing better.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">People
                flow from all around into a small town that
                increases its population on Saturdays from 80 to
                100 thousand depending on the size of the
                stadium. Local police and state troopers direct
                traffic and head off any violators. Fans have
                decorated cars to show their team support and
                fight songs can be heard resonating throughout
                the stands and the streets. The die hard fans
                have shown up a few days before game-day and lay
                claim to their parking space.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">This
                is all going on and the game has not even
                started.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Not
                only is the atmosphere lively, but the stadiums
                are just as entertaining. There are T.V. sets in
                the concourses for those buying food or going to
                the bathroom. Likewise, the scoreboard shows
                instant replays and team highlights on a huge
                Sony screen. Also, for the hard of hearing , the
                speakers are loud enough to ring one&#146;s ears.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Now
                for the ultimate highlight; the game itself. The
                teams begin To warm up about an hour to an hour
                and a half before game time, which is great if
                you are looking for a favorite player or want to
                pick out a coach. The band can also be heard
                streaming into the stadium as fans slowly file
                in.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">The
                game starts and the fun continues. The coaches
                get into it with the referees, fans voice their
                opinion and the rest is history.</font></p>
