                professor told about five of us that we were
                chronic tardy people. Now take it that three of
                the five came in right at the sound of the 9:00
                a.m. clock tower bell and the other and I came in
                three minutes after that bell. We were only late
                to about two other of his classes. Threats such
                as lowering the final project by one letter grade
                is what we have to contend with if we&#146;re in
                violation of his self made Constitution. I can
                understand being late here and there but to out
                right label students as chronic tardy people is
                an insult to us students who pay to attend CSU.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">Sometimes
                things come up and you have to arrive late to
                class. Most professors here at CSU understand the
                minor problems that come up at the last minute
                causing students to arrive a few minutes late to
                class. However, you can clearly see that&#146;s
                not the case with this professor who is of rare
                commodity.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">I
                would like to thank all the professors who
                understand that many of us do have personal lives
                that may sometime interfere with our class
                attendance- Your patience and understanding of
                the legitimate excuses students present is highly
                appreciated.</font></p>
