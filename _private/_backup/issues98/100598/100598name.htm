                <td bgcolor="#000000"><p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>We begin our four-part series on
                the shortcomings in entertainment with a
                discussion of band names. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>A band&#146;s
                name is important. If you hear a catchy new song
                on the radio and want to buy the cd, you need to
                be able to remember it when the d.j. says it. So,
                many bands will have catchy names to get your
                attention. But, do you ever stop to think about
                what the names mean?</strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>Many say
                that the Gin Blossoms had &#147;a pretty name.&#148;
                In actuality, a gin blossom is a red mark on the
                face of a drunk person. Toad the Wet Sprocket
                took their name from a Monty Python sketch.
                Veruca Salt named themselves after the snotty
                little rich girl in &#147;Willy Wonka and the
                Chocolate Factory.&#148; </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>These are
                all examples of &#147;clever&#148; names (as well
                as examples of bands who are no longer together).
                But some bands will be very forward and tell you
                everything that you need to know about them in
                their name. <br>
                One of these groups is The Cherry Poppin&#146;
                Daddies. Now I know that swing is &#147;in&#148;
                and that we, the sheep-like public, have no
                choice but to buy swing music and put on our
                &#147;khakis&#148; and do the &#147;Charleston&#148;
                until our feet are &#147;red,&#148; but do we
                really have to support these clowns?</strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>It is my
                belief that The Cherry Poppin&#146; Daddies (and
                bands like them) are 95% of what is wrong with
                music. (The other 5% involves rappers who sample
                the song &#147;Islands in the Stream.&#148;) </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>So, why do
                people (especially women) support these guys? My
                only guess is that people aren&#146;t stopping to
                think about what the name means. So, to help
                anyone out there who may still be confused, I&#146;ve
                thought up some alternative names for the group
                that will be true to their current name. How
                about the &#147;Virgin Busters&#148;? That would
                be good. Or maybe the &#147;Innocence Takers&#148;.
                Oh, no, maybe the &#147;Tactful Rapists&#148;.
                Yeah, that&#146;s better.</strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>So, how do
                we correct this problem in our music? We stop
                buying their cds. That&#146;s all we can do. So,
                please, I beg of you, do the world a favor and,
                if you must buy swing music, buy something that
                doesn&#146;t insult women. (And then we can start
                to work on the other problem before someone takes
                a sample from &#147;the Gambler&#148; and raps to
                it.)</strong></font></p>
