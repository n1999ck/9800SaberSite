                ROTC program has been on the Columbus College
                Campus for over twenty five years. The purpose of
                the program is to train students to become
                officers in the U.S. Army.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Lieutenant Kernel Gery Truitt,
                Professor of Military Science, is responsible for
                the ROTC program here at Columbus State
                University. Truitt explains the many benefits of
                becoming a part of the ROTC program. &#147;The
                program gives the Cadets a higher sense of
                responsibility. It&#146;s the only program that
                guarantees the students a job right out of
                college in a field of their choice.&#148;</strong></font></p>
                <p><font size="4"><strong>Truitt is proud to be a
                part of something that gives students something
                to look forward to.</strong></font></p>
                <p><font size="4"><strong>This past summer at
                Advanced Camp, the CSU Cadets finished third of
                all the Cadets from the Universities in Florida,
                Georgia, Panama and Puerto Rico. Cadet Dan Wood
                achieved the highest score of over 3,000 in the
                regime. There are 49 Cadets currently in the ROTC
                program and the plan is to double in size within
                the next two years.</strong></font></p>
                <p><font size="4"><strong>The ROTC program also
                offers scholarships to the students, and for
                students who sign on in the program as Juniors
                and Seniors, receive monthly pay.</strong></font></p>
                <p><font size="4"><strong>Master Sergeant Davis,
                Principle Drill Instructor and Operations NCO,
                oversees all physical training. He teaches a
                physical fitness class for the Cadets. His job is
                to develop and train the Cadets. </strong></font></p>
                <p><font size="4"><strong>Davis stated, &#147;the
                class is open to any student at Columbus State
                University. There is no obligation to join the
                program. Some people just come out for the
                physical fitness.&#148;</strong></font></p>
                <p><font size="4"><strong>The newest member to
                the ROTC staff, Captain Irvin Pete, is
                responsible for recruiting ROTC participants. He
                also recruits CSU students from the Fort Benning
                Army station through a program called Green to
                Gold. People who are currently on active duty in
                the Army and want to become officer can come to
                CSU and join the<br>
                ROTC program and also receive a college
                education.</strong></font></p>
                <p><font size="4"><strong>Although ROTC may not
                be for everybody, it is very beneficial. Unlike
                most students may think, ROTC is not all work.
                Besides learning quality leadership skills like
                first aid, land navigation skills, and water
                survival skills, the ROTC program has a host of
                other activities that allows the students to take
                it easy and become more family oriented. Some of
                these activities include a party once a month,
                fund raising, a Spring formal, and visits to the
                Civil War battlefields.</strong></font></p>
