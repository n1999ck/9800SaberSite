            <tr>
                <td bgcolor="#000000"><p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>His objective is clear. He wants
                to make a connection with a major label in order
                to get national distribution of his music. Why
                not? He&#146;s already made a connection with a
                large fan base and Columbus, in general. I
                predict that the major label connection will come
                soon. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>He goes by
                the name of Pinhead, and is backed up by the
                musicians known as The Hellraisers. The <img src="100598pinhead.jpg" align="right" hspace="0" width="320" height="441"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>Hellraisers are Esab Da Insain,
                Johnny Baps, and Galifea.</strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>Pinhead,
                born Johnny Wesley II, attended high school at
                Kendrick here in Columbus. He became interested
                in rapping in 1985 at a local talent show. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>&#147;It
                was just a hobby. I became more serious about
                music in the last three years,&#148; says Wesley.
                He has taken his creativity and stretched over
                into several other aspects of the entertainment
                business.</strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>Pinhead
                has developed his own record label and clothing
                line. The record label, Flipnflava Records is
                backed by Pinhead and other people from the
                Columbus area. Flipnflava simply means versatile,
                having many styles, original and different. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>The rapp
                style that Pinhead performs is called &#147;Split
                Personality&#148;, and quite frankly, I like it.
                I never thought those words would come from me
                about a rapp song or artist, but I like it. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>The album
                is scheduled to be called &#147;Skillz Dat Killz,&#148;
                and has no official release date as of yet. The
                single &#147;Fire And Funk&#148; is available in
                several local stores already. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>The style
                of rapp sounds as if there are several people
                singing at once, but it is all Pinhead. It&#146;s
                like having two or three artists in one person. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>If the
                album is anything like the single, then it is
                going to be good. The song is catchy. After I
                first heard it last week, I caught myself singing
                it all day - well, most of it, because I&#146;ll
                never remember all of the words.</strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>You can
                pick the single up at Blockbuster Music on Macon
                Road or at World Music on St. Mary&#146;s Road.
                And hey, lets all help out and call the local
                radio stations and request Pinhead&#146;s &#147;Fire
                And Funk.&#148; It&#146;s about time these
                stations play something good anyway. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>One other
                thing caught my eye about this guy. When he came
                in to Powertel last week to conduct other
                business (I work there), he gave me a press kit
                with some information I had asked him for. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>It is what
                appears to be his motto, of sorts, or something
                like that. It is printed on every sheet in the
                press kit- &#147;Daring to be different is the
                key to longevity.&#148; </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>I&#146;m
                not sure exactly how far Pinhead will make it in
                the music business, but with the overflow of
                gangster rapp and out right thug, shoot everybody
                rapp crapp, it is nice to see somebody like
                Johnny &#147;Pinhead&#148; Wesley II arrive on
                the scene. His music is a breath of fresh air for
                the rapp scene and personally I hope he gets
                heard.</strong></font></p>
