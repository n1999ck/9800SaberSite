                issue on this campus as far as I can see. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>As a
                junior, and having experienced a lot in my last
                three years here at Columbus State University, I
                have seen the importance of involvement. I cannot
                stress enough how involvement has changed the way
                I have enjoyed my college experience. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>A student
                is more likely to stay in school if he or she
                gets involved in an organization and stays active
                within it. There are plenty of activities to take
                part in if students will just take the initiative
                to get involved. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>There are
                several key reasons why a person should get
                involved in student organizations. The main
                reason is the networking advantages as well as
                the responsibility and experience one obtains. <br>
                I would like to encourage every student on campus
                to get involved in at least one organization on
                campus. It has made a huge difference in my
                college experience and I have benefited from my
                involvement in many ways. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>As Editor
                of the Saber, I would like to encourage more
                students to get involved with the school
                newspaper. There are a couple of staff writer
                positions open as well as a position for a
                columnist. If you have any experience or would
                like to voice your opinion, feel free to stop by
                the office. </strong></font></p>

                poll or write a letter to the editor. Both the
                staff and I would love to hear your opinions
                regarding issues faced on the campus of Columbus
                State University. </strong></font></p>
