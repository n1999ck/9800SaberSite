                Hall, chair of the department of theatre, directs
                this all-CSU production. Actors include Columbus
                senior Jennifer Todd as Mary; Jacquelynne Jordan,
                a freshman from Lawrenceville, playing Alex; and
                Molly Henderson, a senior from Eufaula, Ala.,
                playing Fanny. Jason Home, a senior from
                Columbus, and freshman Gerald Gibson from
                Alpharetta, play multiple roles in the show.</strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>In 1888,
                three female adventurers set out to explore the
                Antipodes. They have made treks before as part of
                an exploring club, but always with an entire
                ensemble of assistants. This time they go out on
                their own. No sooner are they under way than
                strange things begin to happen, such as finding
                things that none of them packed. But this is only
                the beginning. Encountering strange characters
                and unusual situations, they ultimately find
                themselves in the 1950&#146;s. Overmyer&#146;s
                play is a celebration of discovery laced with
                liberal doses of one-ups-manship as the explorers
                try to outdo each other. The time travel scenario
                lends itself to a delightful script full of
                amusing word play.</strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>Alan King,
                assistant professor, designed the set and
                lighting for the production. The action takes
                place on varying levels of a platform. As the
                adventurers visit new locales, projection screens
                provide background scenes.</strong></font></p>

                professor Steven Graver&#146;s costuming may well
                steal the show. From bustled, khaki safari
                costumes to Marilyn Monroe gowns of the 50&#146;s,
                he dresses the cast in period clothing that
                creatively plays to the dialogue.</strong></font></p>
