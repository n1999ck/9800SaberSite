                &gt;&gt; REM will be hitting stores with their
                new album on October 27. The new effort, titled
                &#147;Up&#148;, is their first project since the
                departure of drummer Bill Berry. <img src="up_cover_lrg.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="8" width="92" height="89"></strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>The album,
                the band&#146;s eleventh, has fourteen tracks,
                and is said to be a departure from the style of
                their 1996 release, &#147;New Adventures in
                Hi-Fi.&#148; Inside word on the internet is that
                &#147;Up&#148; picks up where &#147;Automatic for
                the People&#148; left off in 1992. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>I have
                mixed feelings about this, because I think the
                &#147;Hi-Fi&#148; album is excellent and one of
                the band&#146;s best. Of course, album sales
                reflected that most fans have a different opinion
                than mine, but who cares. It is still a great
                album. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>Don&#146;t
                get me wrong, if &#147;Up&#148; picks up where
                the band left off in 1992, then we are in store
                for another great album. Think about it though,
                when was the last time that REM put out a bad
                album? Hint - the answer is never. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>Michael
                Stipe, Mike Mills, and Peter Buck are not
                planning on touring to support the new album,
                which is probably a good idea considering the
                hectic way the last tour went.</strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>&gt;&gt;
                Alanis Morissette&#146;s new album, &#147;Supposed
                Former Infatuation Junkie&#148; is set to be
                released on November 3. The follow-up to her 1995
                debut, &#147;Jagged Little Pill,&#148; has some
                big shoes to fill, considering that &#147;JLP&#148;
                sold over 15 million copies. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>She worked
                with producer, co-writer and musician Glen
                Ballard again on this album, and the final
                project is expected to be as good, if not a step
                up from her previous effort. I&#146;ll believe it
                when I hear it.</strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>&gt;&gt;
                There are several albums hitting stores a little
                sooner than REM and Morissette that are worth
                checking out. On October 6, we will see new stuff
                from Cake, Enuff Z&#146;Nuff, Less Than Jake,
                Depeche Mode Greatest Hits, and a new video from
                Widespread Panic. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>The
                Widespread video comes with a four song live EP,
                and I don&#146;t know why I mentioned Less Than
                Jake - like anybody cares. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>October 20
                brings us &#147;A Little South of Sanity,&#148;
                which is the new live double album from
                Aerosmith. Also being released that day are the
                double album from Ozzy Osbourne Black Sabbath
                Reunion, the Frankie Goes To Hollywood Greatest
                Hits package, and a new album by Vanilla Ice.
                Yes, I said Vanilla Ice.</strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>October 27
                rolls in a new album from Bryan Adams, &#147;Up&#148;
                from REM, a greatest hits package with a few new
                tracks from Motley Crue, and what appears to be a
                Christmas album from Cyndi Lauper. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>Anything
                from Cyndi Lauper will be good, and personally I&#146;m
                looking forward to the new stuff from Motley
                Crue. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>Along with
                Morissette on November 3, we get a live album
                from 311, the b-sides album from Oasis, and a
                greatest hits from Skid Row. It&#146;s almost
                like being in the 80&#146;s again.</strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>&gt;&gt; I
                picked up the album by Eagle-Eye Cherry, &#147;Desireless,&#148;
                last week and I must say, I was impressed. I
                thought he would be just another one hit wonder,
                but apparently the talent runs in the family. <br>
                Eagle-Eye is the son of the jazz great Don Cherry
                and you 80&#146;s/early 90&#146;s music fans will
                remember his sister, Neneh Cherry.</strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>Eagle-Eye
                talked to MTV about his new hit single, &#147;Save
                Tonight&#148; last week: &#147;It&#146;s about a
                bittersweet time, it&#146;s really about the
                perfect evening, with the candlelight and the
                wine and the fireplace. And in turn if you have
                this perfect evening you can probably survive a
                period of being apart. Savoring the moment, and
                maybe a miracle will happen and tomorrow won&#146;t
                even come. It&#146;s also about one of those
                nights where you don&#146;t want the break of
                dawn to arrive.&#148; How depressing. It&#146;s a
                good album anyway.</strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>&gt;&gt;
                Sheryl Crow released her new album, &#147;The
                Globe Sessions,&#148; last week, but I haven&#146;t
                listened to all of it yet to tell if I really
                like it. It sounds more like a blues/country
                album than a rock album so far.</strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>&gt;&gt;
                This is the part of the article I&#146;ve been
                waiting to write all week. Guess who screwed up
                again? You guessed it - Ol&#146; Dirty Bastard
                got himself kicked out of a Berlin hotel last
                week. </strong></font></p>

                being described by officials as &#147;lewd
                behavior&#148; is translated to mean &#147;hanging
                off the balcony naked&#148; by witnesses. These
                reports were taken off the internet, so lets
                remember he&#146;s innocent until proven guilty,
                but how many times can this idiot hide under that
                escape clause? </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>I think he&#146;s
                just plain out guilty, but at least this time he
                didn&#146;t steal anything. Two weeks ago ODB was
                arrested after threatening security officers at
                Hollywood&#146;s House of Blues. Just add that to
                the list of crimes. </strong></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>Look at
                the bright side, if he stays in jail, then he can&#146;t
                put out albums. If this is the best he can
                behave, I say let him, and maybe we will all get
                lucky and next time he will fall.</strong></font></p>
