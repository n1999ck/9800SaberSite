        Minority Affairs sponsored a contest to promote Diversity
        Week. Students were asked to summit a one-page essay
        following the theme, &#147;Beyond our Comfort Zones:
        Understanding the Importance of a Diverse Campus.&#148;
        According to the Director of Minority Affairs, &#147;
        This office held the contest because we at Minority
        Affairs wanted to get students ideas on the importance of
        a diverse campus.&#148; Eight students entered the
        contest to compete for the $100.00 prize. Computer

                <p><font size="4"><strong>Most people grow up in
                neighborhoods, surrounded by persons with
                backgrounds very similar to their own. They go to
                school and play with the same group of friends
                all of their lives. They are never directly
                exposed to those from varying cultural, racial,
                religious, or economic backgrounds. All of their
                knowledge and opinions about other groups of
                people are based on what they hear from their
                friends, their parents, and the media.
                Unfortunately, much of this knowledge is
                inaccurate and prejudicial. When they venture out
                from the neighborhoods, and enter the workplace,
                they unwittingly add to the tension that already
                exists between so many segments of society.</strong></font></p>
                <p><font size="4"><strong>Many people harbor
                prejudicial views and opinions, sometimes without
                recognizing them as such. These opinions are
                formed without firsthand knowledge or examination
                of the facts. This prejudice will manifest itself
                in how they treat people. It may be blatant or
                very subtle. </strong></font></p>
                <p><font size="4"><strong>It could be as simple
                as showing a person less common courtesy because
                they do not happen to come from the same
                background. It could be much more serious. Maybe
                a certain person is hired for a job, because
                historically his or her group is better suited to
                the work. Maybe another person, who was more
                qualified, was denied the same job because his or
                her ethnic or cultural background did not seem
                conducive to the work. The employer failed to see
                the individual. Instead, the focus was on some
                preconceived stereotypes. Unfortunately, this is
                not uncommon. If more people were taught to
                separate the person from the group they happen to
                belong to, the world would certainly improve.</strong></font></p>
                <p><font size="4"><strong>Colleges and
                universities could play a major role in helping
                to eliminate prejudice. Since most people attend
                public schools with the same people from their
                neighborhoods, college is the ideal forum to
                introduce the idea of cultural diversity. The
                enrollments of most major universities consist of
                students from vastly diverse backgrounds. This
                allows students to gain firsthand knowledge about
                different cultures. By providing an arena for
                social interaction between students, universities
                help to lower the walls that separate people into
                groups. This allows the students to see the
                person on the other side, and they can realize
                that the other person is not all that different
                from themselves. Ignorance is the breeding ground
                for prejudice. Universities offer the knowledge
                necessary to combat this infestation, and leave
                the garden of peace and understanding free to
                blossom.</strong></font></p>
