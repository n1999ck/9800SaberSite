        <td><font size="4"><strong>The new transitions occurring
        at Columbus State University are receiving raved reviews
        which tend to be both positive and negative. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>The biggest complaint seems to be with
        the newly acquired Banner system and the ever so popular
        Financial Aid Office. Students seem to be running into
        Admissions problems for many different reasons. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>At the same time people are
        having trouble with both receiving and keeping the money
        they are already eligible for. Lines also tend to be
        longer which results in tension between faculty and
        students. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>As a former employee in the
        Admissions Office, I can honestly say that I understand
        the problems with the transition entirely. Despite all of
        the controversy, Columbus State University proved to be
        very successful at Orientation during early registration.
        </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>An article in the Thomaston
        Times earlier this month mentioned the good and bad
        aspects of the early registration process under the new
        system. But, many of the problems faced by the new
        students were handled as a result of both courteous
        students and faculty. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Everyone just needs to bare
        with the new system for the first year. Nothing in life
        is ever perfect, especially when a system as large as
        Banner is going through. If everyone will show some
        patience and understanding about the whole situation,
        everything will go a lot smoother. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>If you have any doubts about
        your acceptance process or financial aid just ask
        yourself this question. If I am under this kind of
        stress, what kind of stress is the faculty and staff at
        Columbus State University having to overcome? Because,
        these people are the ones that are having to manage the
        transition problems, not the students. </strong></font></p>
