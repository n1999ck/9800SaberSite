        <td><font size="4"><strong>The Student Government
        Association was recently represented at this summer&#146;s
        Student Advisory Council conference. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong><img src="082498sac.jpg" align="right" hspace="0" width="318" height="250"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>The Student Advisory Council holds four
        conferences a year. Jekyll Island hosts the first
        conference of the year and three other institutions host
        the others. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>SAC is made up of
        representatives from each institution within the
        University System of Georgia. These representatives play
        an extremely important role in the system as they make
        recommendations on behalf of 260,000 students within the
        University System of Georgia.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Student Advisory Council
        focuses on three main components which are Student Life,
        Academic Affairs and Legislative Affairs. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Representatives are divided
        into committees where they will then deal with issues
        affecting one of these areas. For example, the Student
        Life committee is currently focusing on three different
        areas. These areas are a system wide healthcare program,
        childcare facilities and computer technology
        equalization. A few accomplishments in the past include
        the Hope Scholarship Program and Semester Conversion.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>In the Academic Affairs
        committee, some other issues were addressed as well.
        Raising the HOPE book allowance to meet the rate of
        inflation, updating school education curriculums to
        adequately prepare prospective teachers for their
        required exams, and finding ways to curb the growing
        number of teachers who will raise a students grade with
        the sole purpose of making them eligible for the HOPE
        Scholarship were among the issues discussed.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The main function for the
        meeting is to handle concerns, and a few were announced
        at this year&#146;s meeting in Jekyll Island. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The main concern dealt with the
        Banner System and the question of whether or not the
        system was compliant with the year 2000 situation. This
        issue is still in discussion and will be solved at a
        later date.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>This new computer software is
        much of the reason why registration and handling
        financial aid has been difficult this year. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Grant Salter, Vice-President of
        Scholastic Affairs, says that the summer conference is a
        brainstorming period to gather problems and issues to
        cover at conferences later in the year. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Grant also stated, &#147;SAC is
        a great way to voice concerns on issues that affect the
        University System. If you have any concerns that need to
        be addressed on a state or local level, please come by
        the Student Government Association Office for more
        information.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Other representatives of CSU at
        the SAC conference were SGA Senators Alin Aiken and Ben
        Wells.</strong></font></p>
