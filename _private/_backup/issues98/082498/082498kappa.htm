        <td><font size="4"><strong>Kappa Sigma Fraternity forged
        it&#146;s way into the history books in early August at
        the 1998 Area II Leadership Conference held at the
        University of Tennessee at Knoxville. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>The Xi-Iota Chapter of Kappa Sigma at
        Columbus State University was represented by ten brothers
        who embarked on the trip to receive one major award, but
        the chapter returned home with several.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The three day trip proved to be
        successful with the brothers attending workshops and
        engaging in a community service project which was
        organized to aid a local elementary school in the
        community. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The highlight of the trip
        occurred on August 1st at the closing banquet. The
        Xi-Iota Chapter received several awards for being #1 on
        the campus of CSU academically for the Fall, Winter, and
        Spring Quarter of 1997. The chapter also received an
        award for being #1 academically above the all mens&#146;
        average as well. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The final award given was the
        F.A.C.E. Award also known as the Founders Award of
        Chapter Excellence. The F.A.C.E. Award is the highest
        achievement given in the Kappa Sigma Fraternity both
        nationally and internationally. Of the 27 F.A.C.E.
        recipients at the 1998 Leadership Conference, the Xi-Iota
        Chapter of Kappa Sigma received this outstanding
        achievement. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The award is based on numerous
        categories involving scholarship, community service,
        publicity, and many more areas. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The Xi-Iota Chapter is one of
        the youngest chapters to receive the award by receiving
        this accomplishment in under two years.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Brannon Kuykendall, President,
        said, &#147;Being a recipient of the Founders Award of
        Chapter Excellence has changed our chapter in many ways.
        In receiving this award we have become one of the top 28
        chapters of the 210 chapters that compose our
        brotherhood. This spotlight has motivated our chapter to
        make 1998-1999 the best year we have ever experienced. We
        will continue to focus on scholarship, community service
        and campus leadership throughout the upcoming school
        year.&#148; </strong></font></p>
