        <td><font size="4"><strong>Mrs. Mary Jane Watkins,
        History Professor, had her first affiliation with
        Columbus State University in 1958, when she came to watch
        her sweetheart play basketball. Watkins began her
        education at CSU in 1960. She received her Bachelors in
        1970 and started teaching at CSU in 1971.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Watkins describes Columbus State
        University as liberating. &#147;Thinking back over my
        years of teaching, the CSU experience has changed the
        lives of many students and opened many doors.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Professor Watkins recalls the
        many changes she&#146;s seen come about at CSU. She
        remembers when all women had to wear dresses or skirts
        and blouses, registration was done on cards and by hand,
        and the CSU mascot was a Rebel. She also states that the
        campus has become more diverse with# global students as
        opposed to an all white college with only Georgia and
        Alabama students.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Other than being in the first
        graduating class at Columbus State University, Watkins&#146;
        achievements include the Educator of the Year Award in
        1986 and the Thomas L. Willey Award in 1993 for the most
        distinguished alumni.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>When asked how she feels about
        the 40th Anniversary of CSU, Watkins pauses, lets out a
        sigh and says, &#147;This 40th anniversary is one of the
        many milestones, and I&#146;m proud to be a part of it.&#148;</strong></font></p>
