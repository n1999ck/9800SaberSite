        <td><font size="4"><strong>The Columbus State athletic
        program has come a long way in forty years and the future
        looks even brighter. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>When
        the basketball team began playing at then Columbus
        College, there was not even a gym on campus. The team
        would practice at Jordan High School and play games at
        Columbus High School. The mascot and colors were also
        different. The team was known as the Rebels and the
        colors were gold and gray. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Changes started taking place on
        April 14, 1965, when the college was made a four year
        institution. The Rebels were coached by Frank &#147;Sonny&#148;
        Clements and the team finished the season with record of
        15-8.The next major change did not occur until April 17,
        1970, when the students voted for the current nickname.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Over the years the program has
        made many division changes. After becoming a four year
        school the team competed in the NAIA, then moved up to
        Division II in 1973, and even had a one year stint in
        Division I. However, because of a decline in student
        enrollment the Cougars were forced to drop out and become
        independent. In 1990 the team joined the Peach Belt
        Conference where they continue today.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Currently the team is coached
        by Herbert Greene who has been at CSU since the early
        eighties and has led the team to 286 wins against 159
        losses.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Although a majority of the
        early athletic history centered around the basketball
        program, there were other sports. Baseball began about
        the same time as basketball and has seen prominent years.
        The golf team has been competing since the 1960&#146;s
        and has won six National Championships. The softball team
        has been competing since the early eighties and is among
        the top teams in Division II. Tennis and cross country
        are other sports that have been around for a number of
        years. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>With a strong basis, the
        athletic programs are headed in the right direction for
        the future. The next big step will be the construction of
        the multi-purpose field house which will provide first
        class facilities for athletes and students alike. </strong></font></p>
