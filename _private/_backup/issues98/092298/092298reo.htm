        <td><font size="4"><strong>A little known fact about REO
        SPEEDWAGON was that they were formed in college&#151;the
        University of Illinois, to be exact, back in the late
        &#145;60s. It was an environment that served as a
        launching pad for the&#146; group to go on and become one
        of rock&#146;s premier groups.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Formed by REO members Newal Doughty
        (keyboards) and Alan Gratzer (drums), who shared rooms in
        the same dorm, the first incarnation of the group played
        its first gigs at fraternity parties, where they would
        sometimes be caught in the midst of food fights. &#147;You
        got paid $40 and all the mashed potatoes we could lick
        off the drums,&#148; recalls Doughty with a laugh. &#147;That
        was our initiation into rock &amp; roll.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;It was an exciting time
        to put a band together. We were the first band on campus
        doing underground music&#151;covers of songs by some
        exciting artists of the time. Alan and I were the only
        guys on campus with long hair. People thought we were
        from outer space.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Says Alan Gratzer of those
        early days: &#147;There were 30 other bands at the time.
        Champaign was a real mecca for rock &amp; roll. We
        concentrated on having lots of fun,&#148; he adds. &#147;One
        of the things we would do was go down into the steam
        tunnels, to which we had access. We&#146;d go down there
        late at night, walk along, and then turn up in the middle
        of the sidewalk on campus, and freak everyone out. It was
        a subterranean world. We&#146;d fall for anything weird.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>One of the songs REO has been
        performing in concert lately is &#147;Golden Country,&#148;
        written by Gary Richrath (lead guitar) back in the late
        &#145;60s as a response to the madness of the Vietnam
        War. It was also one of the songs they played on the
        college circuit. &#147;From the beginning, we&#146;ve
        always enjoyed college audiences. Crowds have always been
        knowledgeable, appreciative, and open to new things.&#148;
        Richrath himself attended college in his hometown of
        Peoria before linking up with the group.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Kevin Cronin went to college
        for three semesters-at Loyola in Chicago-before moving to
        Champaign to join the group. He says: &#147;My dad always
        told me to stay in school and pursue a college education.
        It seemed like good advice, but back in 1969 and 1970, it
        was a time for people to express themselves, and I guess
        I was on the fringe at the time. I heard rock &amp; roll
        calling, and that&#146;s where I headed.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Things, of course, have paid
        off nicely for REO SPEEDWAGON: they&#146;ve made their
        mark on contemporary music with their celebrated live
        shows, powerful songs about honest real emotions and
        record sales nudging 30 million worldwide. Life As We
        Know It, their current and gold-selling LP, is rock &amp;
        roll that tells it all: 10 songs that zero in on life,
        relationships and all the side effects with unusually
        sharp insight.</strong></font></p>
