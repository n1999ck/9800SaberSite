        Communication class, right here at local election time,
        one would think that getting excited about a campaign
        would be easy. Nope. It&#146;s not, until now! Here is
        something we can all get behind and show some support
        for: STREAKING!</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Hear me out. It has recently
        been brought to my attention that streaking has been a
        problem on campus in the past. For those not following
        me, yes, people have run across OUR campus bare bottomed
        naked. My question is, why is this considered a problem? </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>With all of this 40th
        Anniversary talk going on, I think it would be
        appropriate to bring back some of the practices of old,
        and streaking is as good as any. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>All we are lacking is a few
        volunteers. This is where you guys come in. You&#146;ve
        seen the signs around campus that say, &#147;The Saber
        needs your help blah blah.&#148; Well, we do. This can&#146;t
        be done without you. Nobody, and I mean nobody, wants to
        see any of us from the Saber streak naked anywhere, much
        less in public. So, it&#146;s up to you. If there are any
        volunteers, drop me a line at Loxley32@aol.com, or just
        drop by the Saber office. Thanks.</strong></font></p>
