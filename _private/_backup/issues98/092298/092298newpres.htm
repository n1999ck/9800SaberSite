        <td><font size="4"><strong>While 1988 had a bumpy start,
        with bad weather and computer-printer problems, things
        quickly smoothed out. The long awaited appointment of a
        new college president finally took place. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong><img src="092298brownforum.gif" align="right" hspace="0" width="314" height="260"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>The announcement, January 13th, that the
        College&#146;s own Dr. Frank Brown would be appointed
        president, effective January 14th, brought smiles and an
        almost audible sigh of relief across the campus.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>While clearly a favorable
        decision, he seemed to be either the first or second
        choice of almost everyone, Brown will have a rocky road
        ahead. Some will be looking for instant solutions. The
        past president was not the problem. Most of the problems
        are still with us - only the leadership problem has been
        (hopefully) solved.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dr. Brown now has the difficult
        task of pulling the college together and leading it
        forward. Columbus College has tremendous potential that
        only inspired leadership can bring out. We can only hope
        he will be given the chance to do so, and the cooperation
        and support necessary to make it work.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The &#147;healing&#148; process
        has already begun. It started with the establishment of
        the Presidential Search Committee, ably chaired by Dr.
        William J. Frazier. The meeting in which the search was
        conducted, especially by the interviews on-campus of the
        six semi-finalists, allowed issues to be raised and
        problems to be brought out into the sun light. It was a
        worthwhile process.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>During Dr. Brown&#146;s press
        conference, following the announcement of his selection,
        he spoke of the office being a sacred trust, the
        challenges ahead that face us, and the need to &#147;...decide
        who we are as a college.&#148; He also stressed the need
        to &#147;...sell ourselves and tell our story ...... a
        point raised by every presidential candidate.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>When questioned on his approach
        and methods Dr. Brown stressed his desire for improved
        communication, open administration, and easy access to
        administrators. A transition team composed of faculty and
        staff members will be formed to start the ball rolling,
        with advisory groups established as the need arises.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>In a separate interview, when
        questioned about the roles of the SGA and Faculty Senate,
        Dr. Brown indicated that while the roles of the Faculty
        Senate and Student Government may not change he would
        like to see improved results, more ideas, and no closed
        doors. He generally felt that what was needed was better
        communications and working relationships.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dr. Brown also indicated he
        would like to see some type of open forum periodically
        that would include students, faculty, staff, and so on,
        to discuss campus issues and address areas of concern to
        all members of the college community.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>He felt the issue of declining
        enrollment was a pressing one that required effort from
        everyone. Areas such as peer recruitment, high school
        visits by past graduates, students telling their story,
        and involvement with social<br>
        organizations could reap benefits.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>When asked about his goals and
        expectations Dr. Brown stressed the desire to &#147;...be
        out of the office, around the campus and the community
        ... the physical office of the president has been one of
        our problems.&#148; He further indicated that &#147;...I
        just want us to do the usual and do it well ... restore
        pride ... everyone try to make a difference, and ...
        (come) back into the mainstream.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dr. Brown is clearly searching
        for ideas and support - the college deserves no less. One
        particular area he would like input on is the course
        College 105. Is it helpful? What should be changed and
        what should stay the same? For those students who have
        taken the course in the past drop Dr. Brown a short note
        letting him know your thoughts about the class - good,
        bad, or indifferent.</strong></font></p>
