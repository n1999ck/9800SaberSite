        of Columbus College, became widely known as one who
        fostered the warm and effective relationship between the
        college and the surrounding community. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Whitley began his long and productive
        21- year tenure on May 14, 1958. In this time he changed
        the somewhat junior college into a complex senior college
        which offered graduate courses. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dr. Whitley was a native of
        Irwin County, Georgia and received his A.B. and M.E.d.
        degrees from the University of Georgia. He later received
        his Ed.D. from the University of Texas. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Prior to becoming the first
        President of Columbus College, he achieved many great
        things. He was a Teacher-Coach at Tate, Georgia, Dean of
        Students at South Georgia College, Co-ordinator of the
        Junior College development program for the Regents of the
        University System of Georgia, and Vocational Advisor for
        the U.S. Veterans Administration. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>His hobby was known as Columbus
        College and he was known as &quot;A Man on the Job!&quot;
