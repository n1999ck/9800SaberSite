        <td><font size="4"><strong>President Thomas Y. Whitley
        announced on February 27 that the Rebel mascot will no
        longer be a part of Columbus College as of or before the
        official end of this school year. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>The announcement was made at a special
        called assembly of the student body and faculty members,
        held in the Fine Arts Hall auditorium. Dr. Charles A.
        Parker, Chairman of the Education Division, and Lon
        Marlowe, President of the Student Government Association,
        also spoke at the assembly.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dr. Whitley stated that &#147;this
        is the third year we have had lengthy discussions on the
        mascot.&#148; He said he had hoped that as the number of
        black students at Columbus College increased, the student
        body itself would make the change. &#147;This assembly,&#148;
        he added, &#147;is the culmination of the problems of
        this year.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dr. Parker gave the contents of
        a recommendation made by the division chairmen after a
        meeting held approximately three weeks before the
        assembly and the reasons for the recommendation. He
        stated that as the diversity of the student body here is
        increasing and will continue to increase, the controversy
        over the mascot would continue unless a change was made.</strong></font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Disruptive
        Factor</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>This controversy, he said, has
        become a disruptive factor on campus, since the present
        mascot and symbol have not provided unity as they should
        do. Therefore, the division chairmen recommended
        unanimously that Dr. Whitley remove the Rebel from
        contention as the mascot. This recommendation was
        accepted by Dr. Whitley. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>A brochure containing
        illustrations and explanations of the symbolism involved
        in each was distributed at the beginning of the assembly.
        Mr. Marlowe announced that anyone wishing to submit
        another choice for mascot must bring it, along with a
        suitable illustration and a petition bearing the names of
        200 Columbus College students, to the March 4 meeting of
        SGA. In the March 10 and 11 elections to determine the
        new mascot, however, the three original alternatives will
        still be on the ballot, and whichever of those receives
        the highest number of votes will be given the cash prize,
        regardless of whether or not it becomes the new mascot. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dr. Whitley also stated that he
        wished to recognize Andrew Henderson, Ray Lakes, and
        Jackie Marshal. These students, he said, met with him and
        assured him that black students would support the
        basketball team at home games. He added that there had
        been a great improvement in school spirit since that
        time, and that he especially wished to thank Mr. Lakes
        for his leadership in the matter. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>In response to a student who
        asked, &#147;by whose authority is the Rebel removed as
        mascot&#148; Dr. Whitley answered, &#147;I take full
        responsibility, and I do have the authority.&#148; After
        several more questions, the assembly was dismissed.</strong></font></p>
