        <td><font size="4"><strong>During the last two or three
        quarters, since the new cafeteria management took over,
        they have been getting a lot of flack, a lot of negative
        fed that could be construed as throwing stones at the
        sinner, &#147;Dave the Brave,&#148; for causing such
        upheaval and despair amongst our talented, intelligent,
        hard working college students, staff and faculty, and
        especially our athletic department, those wild and crazy
        guys with ferocious appetites. &#147;Burn him at the
        stake,&#148; the people yelled.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Being David Meyers, the cafeteria
        manager after two or three quarters, and having to take
        all kinds of abuse, being called names I wouldn&#146;t
        call my enemies, he has survived through it all. There
        were quite a few attempts&#151;meetings, forums, open
        hearings&#151;to help resolve the problem of the
        cafeteria in general. The main complaints were: not
        enough food, variety, taste, time of business, and the
        way they operate the cafeteria. I&#146;ve been through
        most of the hearing, meetings, etc., but, due to my
        position here, I speak and listen to hundreds of students
        daily and I hear the good, bad, and the ugly.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>To say the least of you&#146;ve
        come a long way, baby. &#147;Dave the Brave,&#148; I just
        knew you could do it. it took a lot of guts. Patients and
        understanding to deal with all of us and come up with a
        compromise for the best interest of all of us, especially
        those obligated to eat here. I feel that since there
        isn&#146;t any mobs or frantic college students trying to
        burn down the cafeteria, and no complaints, David always
        has an open-door policy. He says it&#146;s been quiet in
        the front!</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>This battle is practically over
        as far as I am concerned. Believe me, I know about
        &#147;food.&#148; The changes that David Meyers has
        brought due to recommendations- on our behalf, or what
        the company allows him to do and what he does by himself,
        has increased the questions and increased the stillness
        of the pond.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;Dave the Brave&#148;
        would like to thank everyone who helped make your
        cafeteria a better place of service to you all. I am
        going to list the changes and ideas that have been
        implemented and that are going to be implemented. So,
        listen up and then you can&#146;t say I didn&#146;t know,
        or nobody told me.&quot;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>New students or clients can
        choose within specific guidelines. Pick one entree and
        three side items. (e.g., Pick one hot dog, fries, desert,
        salad, vegetables. You can pick two hot dogs, one fries,
        desert, or salad. You can choose two of the same item if
        you order one entree and something else [that&#146;s
        freedom of choice]).</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#149; Before, you were forced
        to eat what they told you or gave you. Now you can eat a
        balanced meal. The regular meal they may offer, mix it,
        or eat junk food, tried stuff, or whatever you choose.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#149; The lift of restriction
        on what to eat or how has spun a more self- conscious and
        positive attitude towards the cafeteria, especially for
        the next incoming students.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#149; The external changes in
        the cafeteria and face life has made a more pleasant
        place to work in, not dinky and dingy. Believe me, they
        put a lot of work into control of bugs and keeping health
        standards to a very, very high level.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#149; They sell a cup in the
        book store, that whatever you put in it is 39 cents. Get
        it. It&#146;s a good deal if you drink a lot of coffee.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#149; The salad bar by the
        ounce has as much as you want and you pay by the twenty
        ounce.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#149; He&#146;s working on
        getting a new stock of ice creams, yogurt, and frozen
        deserts to sell by cups, half pints, or pints.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#149; They sell cakes made
        fresh while you wait. $8.50 for a plain and $9.50 for a
        decorated one. I am quite sure there is someone out there
        you want to celebrate with. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#149; Howard Hall&#146;s
        improvements are to include hot dog, chili, and similar
        programs.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#149; Restructuring of
        prices-some went up a little and some came down a little.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#149; They are now opened from
        7:00 in the morning to 7:00 in the evening. You have
        twelve hours to eat something.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#149; For all you lazy people,
        they stopped serving breakfast between 10:00 - 10:30. Be
        there or be square.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#149; The biscuits, waffles,
        pancakes, and pizza are made fresh every day.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Well, these thirteen reasons
        seem to be enough for now. Don&#146;t you think so? The
        athletes are the biggest chow hounds and they are not
        complaining. We, the students, appreciate your help and
        concern for our health and sanity. Thanks to everybody
        who had anything to do with the improvements albeit there
        are still improvements to be made. Be patient and work
        with David. Talk to him. Tell him what you feel.
        That&#146;s what he&#146;s there for.</strong></font></p>
