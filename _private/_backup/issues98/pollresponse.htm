        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><strong>&quot;I
        can not stand the smell of cigarette smoke. I cringe
        every time I walk through the courtyard between Howard
        and Arnold Halls. I feel that if people chose to smoke
        they should respect the rights of people who chose not to
        smoke. They should not smoke near entrances. It may be
        cold and raining outside but, if they feel that they need
        a cigarette that bad, they have to deal with the cold and
        rain. The people who do not smoke should not be made to
        suffer because of someone else's nicotine addiction.
        Everyone knows smoking is bad for them, so if you chose
        to ruin your health do not try and ruin mine.&quot;</strong></font></p>

        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><strong>&#147;I
        feel this is a big mistake on behalf of the legal system
        because they need to remember a very important
        cause-affect outcome here. They after all are children
        and as everyone knows children are easily influenced
        because they are trying to figure out who they are as
        well as who the friend or foe is. Any child with this
        type of charge against them will endure extreme teasing
        and cruelty from other children and may eventually
        believe they are bad. They may even develop a personality
        complex that something must be wrong with them. The
        outcome will be that if the child believes he/she is a
        bad person they will do bad things. I believe the legal
        system will deal with them again at an older age all
        because of such a ridiculous charge. People really need
        to take a reality check here.&#148; - Chassity R. Musick</strong></font></p>
