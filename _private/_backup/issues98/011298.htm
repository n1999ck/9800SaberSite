        <p><font size="4">Columbus State University students have
        a chance to visit Spain. Similar to the successful trip
        last summer to Mexico, the Spain trip gives CSU students
        a chance to learn from and enjoy another culture. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><img src="011298/salamanca.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="323" height="227"></font><font size="4">One student who went
        on the Mexico trip, Sharon Langford, says, &#147;It was
        the most intensive learning experience of my life, which
        I will not soon forget.&#148; Langford says she came away
        with a lot from the trip. &#147;You have no choice but to
        learn the language. You&#146;re calling taxies, ordering
        in restaurants and shopping in markets,&#148; she says. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Dr. Alyce Cook, CSU Spanish professor
        says the Mexico trip was a success and she expects the
        same success in Spain. &#147;The group of students that
        went to Mexico learned as much as I&#146;ve ever seen any
        group learn from an experience like this,&#148; Cook said
        in a Spanish 102 class last week. Dr. Cook will be
        traveling with the students to Spain. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The objective of the trip, according to
        literature available through the CSU Language and
        Literature Department, is to provide quality education in
        the classroom as well as outside the classroom. The
        philosophy is to go outside the classroom. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Students who go on the trip will spend
        the month in Salamanca, Spain, a historical city where
        Christopher Columbus studied. The city is a small
        university city with a mid- evil feel and is called the
        cradle of Spanish education. Salamanca is one of the
        oldest university cities in Europe and its Plaza Mayor
        has been recognized by many as one of the most beautiful
        in Spain and Europe. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The cost of the trip is $3700.00. The
        cost includes room and board with a Spanish family,
        airfare, CSU course payment, orientation and three meals
        a day. Also included in the cost of the trip are several
        day trips to nearby cities and three night hotel
        accommodations in Madrid. Other cities to be visited are
        Escorial, Avila, Segovia and La Aberca. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">A limited amount of scholarships are
        available. Also, other loans and financial aid is
        available. Eligible students can apply financial aid such
        as Pell grants, HOPE scholarships and others to the
        courses taken Spain. Students who pass the course will
        receive 12 credit hours. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Cook says to raise money for last
        year&#146;s trip, students held a car wash which proved
        unsuccessful. However, she also says that one student who
        attended the Mexico trip actually raised over $800.00
        selling candy bars. Cook warns students not to get caught
        up in deciding you can not go because you are married,
        have children or a job. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">&#147;Some employers actually
        encouraged students to go,&#148; Cook says. According to
        Cook some employers offered time off and worked around
        the trip schedule. Cook says to make up your mind that
        you are going to go, and the money can be found somehow. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The trip will be from June 29 until
        July 30 of this year. Classes are held from 9 a.m. to 1
        p.m. daily. Between classes students are free to travel
        on their own. Passports should be made well in advance.
        Anyone interested going one the trip should contact Dr.
        Cook at the Language and Literature Department. </font></p>
