        the uncomfortable feeling of walking to the dorms or to
        the parking lot late at night. A new escort service,
        which went into affect on campus September 8th, is aimed
        at helping students arrive safely to their dorm rooms and
        vehicles.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong><img src="091498cruises.jpg" align="right" hspace="0" width="314" height="225"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>Known
        as &#147;Courtyard Cruises&#148;, the service provides
        students a ride, via golf cart, to Courtyard I or to any
        of the parking lots on campus from 7:00pm - 11:30pm
        Monday through Thursday. Students simply call 568-2022
        and inform security of their location and the escort will
        pick them up. Those who reside at Courtyard 11 will be
        able to use the service once the city puts the sidewalk
        in.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Before this service, Campus
        Police would normally receive 4 or 5 escort requests a
        night. According to Jasper Cook, Chief of Public Safety,
        students would sometimes have to wait 10- 15 minutes for
        a ride. Cook continued by stating that since a student
        assistant has been hired solely for escorting students,
        the officers can now concentrate on their main job and
        students are not inconvenienced. However, the officers
        will continue to provide escorts when needed.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>This is the first time a
        service like this has been in place at CSU as far as Mr.
        Cook knows. He and the Residence Life staff decided the
        escorting was greatly needed on campus with the increase
        of the student body as well as the many dorm students
        without vehicles. Improvements or changes to the program
        will be made as needed.</strong></font></p>
