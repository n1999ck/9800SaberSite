        <td><font size="4"><strong>The opening week of college
        football brought some surprises and big disappointments
        for area schools. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Auburn
        was drilled 19-0 in a Thursday night game on ESPN.
        Quarterback Len Baird was given little opportunity to
        throw the ball and the running game was not much better.
        Virginia led at the half 6-0, and continued to add points
        in the second half in part to Auburn mistakes. The season
        does not get any easier as the Tigers face Ole Miss in
        Oxford. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The Georgia Bulldogs on the
        other hand had a much easier task in facing Kent.
        Freshman quarterback Quincy Carter threw for three
        touchdowns and finished with 256 yards as the Dogs
        cruised to a 56-3 victory. Georgia should face a tougher
        task this weekend when they travel to South Carolina. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Well, so much for making
        predictions as Georgia Tech suffered a 41-31 loss to
        Boston College. The defense had too many holes and the
        offense could not keep up with the pace. The Yellow
        Jackets will have one more tune up game against New
        Mexico State before opening ACC action against North
        Carolina. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Unlike Georgia Tech, Alabama
        had a successful campaign against BYU winning 38-31. The
        Tide was led by Shaun Alexander who ran for five
        touchdowns and was named SEC offensive player of the
        week. Another surprise was the passing of John David
        Phillips who appeared calm under pressure and had no
        interceptions. The Tide will play Vanderbilt in
        Birmingham. </strong></font></p>
