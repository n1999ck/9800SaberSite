        <p><font size="4"><strong>Hopefully in the last issue
        everyone noticed &#147;Health Weekly,&#148; a brand new
        column of the Saber. This column will be a regular
        feature addressing health and wellness issues of interest
        to students. &#147;Health Weekly&#148; will be written by
        different members of the Student Nursing Association, a
        CSU student organization of nursing (Associate Degree and
        Bachelor Degree) and pre-nursing majors. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>These members will be writing
        about health topics that relate specifically to students
        and young adults, general health topics, as well as the
        &#147;happenings&#148; of the Student Nursing
        Association. The purpose of this column is to inform
        readers about issues which can improve and protect your
        physical health. We also hope to educate students about
        the Student Nursing Association and what activities we
        participate and are involved in both on campus and in the
        Columbus community at large. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>We are excited about writing
        health articles that interest CSU students, columns that
        provide you with information you find valuable. The
        Student Nursing Association would like to hear from you
        about future articles you would like to see in &#147;Health
        Weekly&#148;. E-mail your ideas to Jennifer Robinson
        through campus e-mail or call 569-1506. We want your
        input!</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>In the next issue James
        Underwood, the President of the Student Nursing
        Association, writes about a recent set of models the
        Senior Baccalaureate class bought for the Maternal/Child
        nursing department. These models are not like anything
        that you have seen in the Biology lab-this I promise you!
        To give you a hint, these models will assist nursing
        students in learning to determine how close to delivery a
        woman in labor is. Look for it in the next issue of The
        Saber.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Students interested in learning
        more about CSU&#146;s Student Nursing Association should
        plan to attend our next meeting tentatively scheduled for
        October 5(Monday) at 11:30 in Illges Hall room 317.
        Interested students are also encouraged to contact James
        Underwood through school e-mail or phone 569-8212 for
        more information.</strong></font></p>
