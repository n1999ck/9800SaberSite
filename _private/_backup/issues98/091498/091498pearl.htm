        <td><font size="4"><strong>I had the pleasure of getting
        to attend two Pearl Jam shows two weeks ago, and let me
        tell you, if you missed them, you missed something
        special. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>The
        first show of the week for me was the Atlanta show at
        Lakewood Amphitheater on September 1. Mudhoney was the
        opening act, and only about 50 of the 19,000 plus in
        attendance really cared that they were playing. I suppose
        they were ok, but we just wanted Pearl Jam to take the
        stage as soon as possible. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Mudhoney knew as much and held
        their set to 45 minutes. This show was special for me,
        because I was able to be there with a dear friend and
        most beautiful person I know- who&#146;s name will not be
        mentioned for the sake of my health. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Finally it was time for Eddie
        Vedder and company to take the stage. The stage was
        decorated with five candles and several angel-like
        ornaments. &#147;Hail Hail&#148; was the opener and it
        was crazy from there on out. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The band sailed through news
        songs, old songs, and a few cover songs. It is terribly
        difficult to pick a favorite moment of the night, but
        there were several highlights. &#147;Do the Evolution&#148;
        and &#147;Wishlist&#148; took on new forms when done
        live, and &#147;Alive&#148; was better than ever with the
        new guitar solo tacked on at the end by Mike McCready. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Magazines and television shows
        have stated that the band appears to be more relaxed and
        that they look like they are finally enjoying the success
        that they have attained. Well, the reports appear to be
        correct. The evidence is in the bands songs and their
        performance. Smiles could be seen from everybody on
        stage, especially frontman Eddie Vedder. At times he
        would just lean back, smile and watch the rest of the
        band do their stuff. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Ex-Soundgarden drummer Matt
        Cameron did a great job filling in for the absent Jack
        Irons on drums. If their appearance is not enough to
        prove their new found happiness, then just listen to the
        lyrics. &#147;I&#146;m not so overwhelmed. It seems so
        simple now..&#148; is what Vedder sings in the song
        &#147;In Hiding.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;Black&#148; was another
        favorite of the night for me. &#147;And all I taught her
        was everything&#148; got a nudge from the beautiful girl.
        Interesting. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Eddie was very crowd friendly,
        and that gave the stage crew fits. He actually came out
        into the crowd right in front of me during the song
        &#147;Porch&#148; and seemed right at home being held
        upright by several very happy fans. <br>
        The two tack on songs to &#147;Daughter&#148; and &#147;All
        Those Yesterdays&#148; are REM songs, and the Yeastie
        Girls song was a little rap done by Eddie from a
        California band he likes. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The full setlist for the
        Atlanta show is as follows: &#147;Hail Hail,&#148; &#147;Animal,&#148;
        &#147;Given to Fly,&#148; &#147;Do the Evolution,&#148;
        &#147;Dissident,&#148; &#147;Corduroy,&#148; &#147;I Got
        Shit,&#148; &#147;Wishlist,&#148; &#147;Even Flow,&#148;
        &#147;In Hiding,&#148; &#147;Last Exit, (Yeastie Girls
        song),&#148; &#147;Off He Goes,&#148; &#147;MFC,&#148;
        &#147;Better Man,&#148; &#147;Brain of J,&#148; &#147;Alive,&#148;
        &#147;Go,&#148; &#147;No Way,&#148; &#147;Rearviewmirror,&#148;
        &#147;Daughter/ (Talk About the Passion)&#148; &#147;(All
        Those Yesterdays)/(The Wrong Child),&#148; &#147;Black,&#148;
        &#147;Porch,&#148; and &#147;Yellow Ledbetter.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The Birmingham show was
        September 3 at Jefferson Colloseum. Mudhoney was the
        opener again and got about the same repsone as at the
        Atlanta show. Eddie and company - Mike, Jeff, Stone, and
        Matt were at the top of their game again. Jeff and Mike
        hardly opened their eyes the whole show, and Eddie and
        Stone danced around and seemed to be having a blast. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>They changed the setlist up a
        bit from the other show. They played the basic songs that
        were expected, but threw in some surprises like &#147;Footsteps,&#148;
        Faithful,&#148; &#147;Elderly Woman&#148;, and the b-side
        &#147;Leatherman.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The shocker and highlight of
        the show came at the end when the band, wearing smiles
        and big silver sunglasses, kicked in an excellent version
        of the Who classic, &#147;Baba O&#146;Riley.&#148; Eddie
        ended the show with a Roger Daltrey-like(former Who
        vocalist) swing of the microphone, leaving it hanging
        from the lighting fixture above as the band exited the
        stage.</strong></font></p>
