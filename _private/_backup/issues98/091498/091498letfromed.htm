        decision upon whether the President should be impeached
        or not, what is the President thinking? </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>What started out as a straight out
        denial has turned out to be a nightmare for both the
        President's family and White House officials. If things
        could not get worse, the denial became a lie as Monica
        Lewinsky proved the affair with evidence of her own. DNA
        samples proved to match President Bill Clinton which
        forced him to admit on national television that he did
        have sexual relations with Miss Lewinsky. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>However, Clinton states that
        these accusations were wrong. The President said the two
        did not have sex, but merely made sweet love the short
        time they were together. If you ask me, I feel as if he
        has begun to dig a deeper grave for himself. This not
        only made him look like he strayed, but made him seem as
        if he had no feelings for his family all together. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Ken Starr has submitted his
        report to the Judiciary House Committee which outlines a
        case for impeaching President Clinton on 11 grounds.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The first 445 pages of the
        Starr Report are being reviewed with an estimated 2,600
        pages of supporting material still waiting to be
        reviewed. The biggest question is, What will be the final
        call? Will the President be impeached? Should the
        President be impeached? These are all answers that will
        eventually arise after the review of the Starr Report.</strong></font></p>
