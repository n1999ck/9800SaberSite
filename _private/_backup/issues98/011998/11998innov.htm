<p><font size="4">For most, eating out is hard on the budget, but
there are places where you can get the most for the money.
Several places offer cheap eating where you can actually get
stuffed. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">If you crave Chinese food &#147;China
Buffet&#148; on Macon Road offers over eighty items for about
five dollars until 5:00 p.m. What you want to do to take full
advantage of the buffet is get there about 4:30 p.m., pay for
lunch, and then eat slowly. Around 5:00 p.m. they will start
putting out shrimp, snow crab legs, and sometimes crabcakes. Now
the buffet is fair game, you may draw a few discouraging looks
from the proprietor but not to worry I have yet to be asked to
leave. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Now, if it is Italian you crave two restaurants
and a pizza chain come to mind. Mazzio&#146;s and Pizza Hut, both
offer lunch buffets with Mazzio&#146;s offering the same deal in
the evening on Tuesday&#146;s. With Little Ceasars you can
sometimes go in and ask for canceled orders and barter them down
to around five bucks for a large pizza. Some might question the
legality of ordering pizzas and then showing up three hours later
to purchase them at discounted rates, but I&#146;ve heard from a
few people that this actually works and Little Ceasars is always
happy to sell rather than throw away pizza. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">If it is Mexican you want, El Vaquero always
has dirt cheap food which includes all the chips and salsa you
can eat, for example, burrito ($2.30) + water + chips/salsa=
fullness. Rio Bravo offers free, you heard right, free tacos,
from 4-6 p.m. Monday through Friday, but may require the purchase
of an alcoholic beverage. If it&#146;s hot sandwiches or chicken
fingers the cheapest in town is Red Rider. It&#146;s somewhat of
a Jurassic Park of a bar but, if you can get past the smoke and
Patsy Cline songs you can get two grill cooked burgers and fries
or chicken fingers for just over five dollars. The last and least
advisable tactic for cheap food is done frequently by a CSU
student who will be known only as Big A. Big A likes to enter the
Magic Mart and prepare two hot dogs for purchase, he then stands
with his back to the cashier and quickly devours two, sometimes
three hot dogs. The grand total for such fine and underhanded
dining comes to $1.89, drink included.</font></p>
