<p><font size="4">The countdown has begun to Super Bowl XXXII, to
be held in San Diego, California on January 25. The mighty
cheese-heads of Green and Gold will square off with a bunch of
charging stallions from the Rockies in this year&#146;s premier
football event. As the fans of Green Bay and Denver begin pricing
airline tickets to California and arm-chair quarterbacks begin
deciding who&#146;s going to buy the beer, gamblers all around
the land are scrambling to get the latest news and notes on the
two teams in hope that the football gods will shine a divine
light on one particular team.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I, being the almighty &#147;Great Guru&#148;
that I am, already know the outcome of the game, so I don&#146;t
have to bother with the Vegas lines and other trivial matters
like that. Before I let the cat out of the bag, let&#146;s look
at both teams.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Denver Broncos enter their fourth Super
Bowl under the direction of future Hall of Famer John Elway. The
Broncos were defeated handily in their last Super Bowl visits,
the latest a thrashing in 1989. It is easy to say that the
Broncos have a Super Bowl jinx and will turn into another annual
big game loser, well not so fast. The Broncos are a much improved
team than they were in their past visits. The biggest improvement
is in their running game.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In their past Super Bowl appearances, the
Broncos had to rely mostly on passing, with the addition of Pro
Bowl back Terrell Davis, Denver has added a strong ground game to
their arsenal. The strong rushing of Davis was key in the
Bronco&#146;s 24-21 victory over the Pittsburg Steelers in the
AFC Championship game. The win made the Broncos only the fourth
wild-card team since 1978 to reach the SuperBowl.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Green Bay Packers earned another trip to
the Super Bowl by dominating the San Francisco 49ers 23-10 in
front of the Niners home crowd. The Packers used a 222 yard
passing day from Brett Favre and a stingy defense to shut down
San Francisco, a team many were picking to go to the Super Bowl.
Green Bay will enter their second straight Super Bowl with a very
balanced team on all sides of the ball. The Packers have the
strong arm and accuracy of Brett Favre and the hard running of
Dorsey Levens on offense, and on defense, the Packers have two of
the best in the game in Reggie &#147;Are you eating your chunky
soup&#148; White, and the big 300 plus pounds of Brian Williams.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">OK, enough of the stats and flash backs,
let&#146;s get down to business. To put it plainly, the Green Bay
Packers are going to win their second straight Super Bowl. The
Packers are just too dominating of a team to think otherwise. To
Denver&#146;s credit though, they are a whole lot better than in
the past, but the Packer defense is just too good, and even if
the Broncos score a substantial amount of points they have no
defense capable of holding Brett Favre&#146;s air assault. The
line on the game is the Packers by 13 and a half but I see it a
little different. The Guru says ...... Packers by 20.</font></p>
