<p><font size="5">The Greek Council of Columbus State University
has started a tradition on campus that will hopefully grow in the
years to come. The formation of the Homecoming event at Columbus
State University is composed of many events and attractions that
will hopefully spark an interest for students to become more
involved in the future. I am excited to see such a great event
occurring on the CSU campus. I feel as if the variety of events
and involvement of organizations will prove to be an enormous
success for not only the organizations participating, but for the
students and campus of Columbus StateUniversity as a whole.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Homecoming will be a long week of activities
that are sure to increase student involvement as well as school
spirit. To see such an event taking place is truly phenomenal.
Such events as a talent show, Island Fest, Pep Ralley and Cookout
at the Clocktower, a Parade and a Band Party are a few examples
of the events taking place throughout the week. The Greek Ball is
the biggest event of all and will include such announcements as
best overall organization for the week and let us not forget the
Homecoming King and Queen.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">But, this event is not all play and no work.
Each Greekorganization as well as other organizations will have
to apply a lot of time and effort for the week to go as planned.
Each organization will be given responsibilities and tasks to
perform in order for the week to be a success. These
responsibilities will give organizations a chance to work
together and increase student involvement on this campus. But,
the campus and students are not the only people benefiting from
this week. The kids of the 30th avenue school are getting a
chance to get tutored by students of the organizations as well.
This will give the kids a chance to meet new faces and the
students to aid the community as well.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The Greek Council of Columbus State University
along with other organizations on campus are making great strives
to increase student involvement on campus. I feel as if
Homecoming will prove to be a great success and pave the way for
increased student involvement for the years to come. Hopefully,
the Homecoming event will encourage more students on campus to
get involved with organizations on the CSU campus.</font></p>
