        photography.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Neises
        was born outside of Boston, Massachusetts. So how did he
        end up at CSU?&nbsp; He has been a member of a military

        brat.&#148; His family moved to Columbus his senior year
        in high school, during which he attended Hardaway High.
        Neises was involved in soccer, cross country, and drama
        in high school. He also entered his artwork in exhibits.
        He had the honor of one of his photographs being
        purchased for the permanent collection of the high
        school.</strong></font></p>

        photography for eight years and says art is his
        &#147;form of expression.&#148;&nbsp; While at CSU, he
        has entered the Student Show exhibit and has even sold a
        few pieces.&nbsp; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>When asked what he thinks about
        Columbus State University, Neises said, &#147;I like the
        people here, and CSU is not so big that it&#146;s
        overwhelming but not so small it&#146;s ridiculous.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>He plans to go to graduate
        school and pursue a career in art history, teaching, or
        working in an art gallery.</strong></font></p>
