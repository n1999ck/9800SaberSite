        <td><font size="4"><strong>Imagine going to Memorial
        Stadium to see the Cougars trounce cross state rival
        Valdosta State or compete against perrenial power North
        Alabama. We have all seen the shirts that say &#147;Columbus
        State football, still undefeated.&#148; Why not make it a
        reality?</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>College
        football is a great selling point for an institution.
        Students, faculty, and the community as a whole would
        have another outlet to congregate and show support. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Not only is the game fun, but
        the atmosphere is electric. Supporters bring in their
        campers a few days before the game to just hang out and
        get a good parking space. During homecoming week, the
        schools host a parade through town and have additional
        events leading up to the game. All of the events are
        culminated with the actual game which at the time seems
        secondary. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Now for the more serious side,
        football brings in money for an athletic department. The
        majority of Division I schools are supported by their
        football program. The revenue that television, ticket
        sales, and bowl appearances bring in is astronomical. In
        turn, it allows for lesser known sports such as track and
        field or soccer to compete. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>With that said, let the band
        fire up the fight song, the players enter the field, and
        Columbus State football become a reality. </strong></font></p>
