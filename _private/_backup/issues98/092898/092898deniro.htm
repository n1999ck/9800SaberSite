        would be extremely difficult for me to choose my favorite
        actor. The list is full of great performers, such as Andy
        Garcia, Al Pacino, and Jack Nicholson. However, one man
        seems to stand out from all the others - Robert De Niro.
        He is truly what a great performer should be, so I just
        want to share a bit of information about him with
        everyone. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>De
        Niro was born on August 17, 1943 in New York, New York.
        At one time several years ago, he dated model Naomi
        Campbell - way to go Robert! But, two wives later, he
        appears to be very happy with Grace Hightower. They were
        married on June 17, 1997. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The grand total, all
        relationships combined, gives him three sons and one
        daughter. They are Drena De Niro, Raphael De Niro, Aaron
        Kendrick, and Julian Henry. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Here&#146;s some stuff you
        probably didn&#146;t know, and probably don&#146;t need
        to know, but I&#146;m telling you anyway. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>In his 1980 Oscar acceptance
        speech he thanked Joey LaMotta, who was at the time suing
        United Artists Productions over the movie &#147;Raging
        Bull,&#148; which is a portrayal of LaMotta. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>De Niro was the spokesperson
        for the television commercials for AMC Ambassador
        automobiles in 1969 and formed his production company,
        TriBeCa Productions, in 1989. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>In the past years, De Niro has
        graced the cover of many magazine publications, such as
        &#147;Esquire,&#148; &#147;Premiere,&#148; &#147;Empire,&#148;
        and &#147;Studio.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>As far as I&#146;m concerned,
        Robert De Niro is one of the major reasons that the movie
        industry and &#147;Hollywood&#148; is alive and well
        today. Don&#146;t believe me? Hit the rental store and

        Brown,&#148; &#147;Wag the Dog,&#148; 1998 - &#147;Great
        Expectations,&#148; and &#147;Ronin&#148; is next.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Ronin was originally set for
        release on October 2, but after several low and
        disappointing screening scores, they went back into the
        studio and made a few changes. Scores improved a great
        deal and the release date is now set for September 25. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>In this movie, De Niro plays
        one of several CIA-like agents who team up for private
        cases. Things go wrong on a dangerous job in Europe. When
        the team is double-crossed, each member begins to reveal
        his true self. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Like I said before, Robert De
        Niro is one of the greatest performers we will ever see.
        Not all of the movies listed above are good movies, but I
        can guarantee you that whatever is wrong with the movie,
        it sure ain&#146;t De Niro.</strong></font></p>
