        <td><font size="4"><strong>A Columbus State University
        student recently took her education to the outback. Laura
        Forrester recently returned from her trip to Australia
        where she not only studied, but gained valuable life
        experiences as well. <img src="092898aust2.jpg" align="right" hspace="0" width="370" height="266"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>As part of a program branching from
        Boston University, Forrester spent a month in Australia
        this past summer taking classes. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Forrester is a transfer student from
        Bainbridge College pursuing her Bachelor&#146;s Degree in
        Biology. She is a senior and says that she plans to
        pursue her Master&#146;s in Environmental Science soon
        after graduation. She came to CSU as a result of her
        involvement in Student Government and was encouraged to
        attend Columbus State University by the Dean of Students
        at her previous institution. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>During her trip to Australia,
        Forrester achieved and experienced many things at the
        same time. As part of a team who conducted a Tropical
        Rainforest Restoration Study, she learned a lot about the
        environment in Australia and the culture as well. She was
        able to actually live in a rainforest for an entire month
        where she was unable to take a shower. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Forrester states that, &#147;It
        really does rain all of the time in a rain forest.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Forrester was also a part of a
        group who wrote a constitution for an environmental plan
        regarding a small area in Australia named Yungaber. She
        was also able to meet other students representing
        different counties <img src="092898aust1.jpg" align="left" hspace="0" width="256" height="310"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>such as France, Germany, England and
        Asia. However, her one month stay turned out to be longer
        than expected. Forrester decided to embark on a great
        journey and stay an entire extra month on her own. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>She says, &#147;I planned to
        stay because I never thought that I would go back any
        time soon.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Her extended stay proved to be
        valuable as she experienced many things. Laura traveled
        over 5,000 miles on a Greyhound Bus while covering all of
        the east coast and outback of Australia. She spent an
        overwhelming thirty-six hours on a bus while traveling to
        Melbourne. Forrester learned how to live outdoors as she
        slept anywhere she could to get by for the night. She
        slept mainly in youth hostiles, but an occasional bench
        or flowerbed was never out of the question.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Forrester&#146;s trip allowed
        her to go scuba diving near the Great Barrier Reef. She
        was also able to experience the economy and food as well.
        Laura says that pork is the primary food in Australia,
        but overall it is not that different. Economically, there
        is a little difference. Fruit is the major business in
        Australia, and minimum wage starts at $10.00 an hour. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>She also enjoyed many
        encounters with such animals as kangaroos and koala
        bears. Overall, Laura felt that her trip was a success
        and that she would love to go back again. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>She concludes by saying, &#147;I
        came back knowing that I am independent and that I can do
        things myself.&#148; </strong></font></p>
