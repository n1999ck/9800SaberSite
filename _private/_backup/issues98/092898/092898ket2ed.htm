        <td><font size="5"><strong>A Breath of Fresh Air</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>On Wednesday Sept-ember 16th, I had a
        most uplifting experience here on campus. Arriving on
        campus at about 7:30 a.m., in my usual morning fog, I
        stopped by the men&#146;s restroom in Arnold Hall on my
        way in to the office. Unknown to me, while there I
        dropped my checkbook. Sometime in the mid-afternoon my
        wife called me from home and asked me if I had our
        checkbook. As I told her that I did, I reached back
        instinctively and touched the pocket I had put it in that
        morning. I felt a knot grow in my stomach as I realized
        it was no longer there. When I then told her that it was
        missing, she informed me she had just received a call
        from a Columbus State University student who told her he
        had found it that morning and wanted to return it. I
        called the student and we made arrangements to meet so he
        could return the lost checkbook.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>In these times we live in, this
        student&#146;s behavior was not what I would have
        expected. I know it&#146;s not fair or right to make
        assumptions about people you don&#146;t know, but I think
        if I had discovered the checkbook missing prior to this
        student&#146;s phone call, I would have already called
        the bank and put a stop payment on all those missing
        checks. My natural inclination would have been to protect
        myself because I would have expected the person who found
        my checkbook to have attempted to clean out my checking
        account, or at the very least to have helped themselves
        to an extravagant purchase. This was one of those times
        when it was nice to be proven wrong.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>This incident has done much to
        restore my faith in mankind and confirm my faith in the
        student body here at CSU. I have always felt that we had
        a great group of students attending this university. Now
        I know that beyond a shadow of a doubt. Thank you Robert.
        Thank you very much, not only for the return of my
        checkbook, but also for making me look with pride at the
        people I associate with every day.</strong></font></p>
