        Committee on Placement and Cooperative Education
        (USC-PACE), chaired by CSU&#146;s own Lesa Kerlin,
        director of the Career Center, hopes to have
        &#147;Georgia HIRE&#148; (Hiring Initiative for
        Recruitment Excellence) fully operational by January
        1999.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>&quot;Georgia
        HIRE&quot; is a web-based program that will provide
        employers with access to all of the intellectual capital
        of the University System of Georgia at one site,&#148;
        Kerlin explains. In partnership with JobTrak Corporation,
        the site gives employers access to resumes of Georgia
        students and recent alumni, as well as providing them
        with a place to post their job openings. Browsing the
        resume base is free. For a reasonable fee, employers can
        post their job openings, which are then available to all
        units within the University System participating in the
        program. Students will be able to access &#147;Georgia
        HIRE&#148; without charge.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Both Kerlin and Annie Hunt
        Burriss of the Board of Regents, with whom USC-PACE is
        working closely, perceive &#147;Georgia HIRE&#148; as a
        marketing tool that chambers of commerce will use in
        recruiting employers to relocate to Georgia. No other
        state has such a program, partly due to Georgia&#146;s
        unique, single university-system framework, according to
        Kerlin.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;Georgia HIRE&#148; will
        be beneficial to smaller and rural schools in the system
        because it will, in effect, level the playing field. By
        piggybacking onto the name recognition of the University
        of Georgia and Georgia Tech, their students&#146; resumes
        will be available to the same pool of potential
        employers, since all resumes will be in the same
        database.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Although the committee&#146;s
        work is &#147;a huge undertaking,&#148; Kerlin says it
        has been &#147;very helpful in building cohesiveness
        within the University System of Georgia.&#148; Proof of
        this is the fact that 29 of the 34 colleges and
        universities in the system have signed on to participate
        in &#147;Georgia HIRE&#148; the first year.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;Sometimes we forget that
        part of what we do is help students to a career,&#148;
        Kerlin says. When that function is successfully
        accomplished, everyone benefits by producing &#147;happy,
        contributing employees who in turn become the best
        possible salespeople for their school.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Public service announcements
        are set to begin soon across the state. Look for more
        information about &#147;Georgia HIRE&#148; on campus
        soon.</strong></font></p>
