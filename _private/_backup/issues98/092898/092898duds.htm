        <td><font size="4"><strong>In 1996 MTV Pictures made
        their first attempt at the big screen with a movie about
        talking roaches called &#147;Joe&#146;s Apartment&#148;.
        Without a doubt, and without questioning why, MTV failed
        miserably. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>However,
        this time around MTV and Paramount Pictures teamed up to
        put forth what seemed to be an all around better effort
        when releasing &#147;Dead Man on Campus&#148; this past
        month. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>We were all hoping for the best
        when MTV dazzled us with fairly big names such as
        Mark-Paul Gosselaar who played TV&#146;s Zack on &#147;Saved
        by the Bell&#148; and Tom Everett Scott who starred along
        side with Tom Hanks in &#147;That Thing You Do.&#148; But
        once again our hopes were crushed with a small plot and
        even less comedy. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Overall, movie patrons left the
        theater disappointed not only with the movie, but with
        MTV Pictures all together. Along with &#147;Dead Man on
        Campus,&#148; many other movies that were released over
        the summer weren&#146;t really worth watching. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>In case you missed the summer
        duds I&#146;ve compiled a list of movies NOT to rent this
        fall when released on video. This list should save you a
        little money, a lot of time, and even more heartache. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>1. &#147;Lethal Weapon 4&#148;
        - There was little more action this time around. In fact,
        Chris Rock was a nice touch to the movie, but he doesn&#146;t
        make the movie any more enjoyable than the first three. I
        think it&#146;s about time for the producers to know when
        to stop.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>2. &#147;Godzilla&#148; - Just
        a little too much hype, and not enough destruction. A
        plot would have been helpful as well. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>3. &#147;Wrongfully Accused&#148;
        - If you&#146;ve seen one Leslie Nielsen movie, then you&#146;ve
        seen them all. Enough said.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>4. &#147;Why Do Fools Fall in
        Love?&#148; - First of all this is the story of Frankie
        Lymon. Who is Frankie Lymon, you might ask. Exactly my
        point. I know we can think of something better to base a
        movie about. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>5. &#147;How Stella Got Her
        Groove Back&#148; - Alright, I actually heard this was a
        good movie based on an even better book. But if you&#146;re
        like me, you don&#146;t really care about Stella or her
        groove. I&#146;d imagine the creators of this one could
        have thought a little longer about the title.</strong></font></p>
