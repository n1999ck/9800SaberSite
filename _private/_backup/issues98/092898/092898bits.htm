        weeks ago, U2 is set to release a new greatest hits
        package, &#147;U2 The Best of 1980-1990,&#148; as part of
        a three-album, $50 million deal with Polygram Records.
        Well, more information has been released about the
        package in the last several days. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>U2 plans to issue the compilation of
        b-side tracks as a giveaway disc to be sold along with
        the &#147;Best Of&#148; album. Here is the catch - you
        can only get the b-side album during its first week of
        release. The limited edition, double-disc set, called,
        &#147;U2 The Best of 1980-1990&#148;, is due out on
        November 3.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The track listing for the
        B-sides album is as follows: &#147;The Three Sunrises&#148;

        from &#147;The Unforgettable Fire,&#148; &#147;Bass Trap&#148;
        from &#147;The Unforgettable Fire,&#148; &#147;Dancing

        Want Is You,&#148; &#147;Walk to the Water&#148; from
        &#147;With or Without You,&#148; &#147;Luminous Times

        Hotel&#148; from &#147;Angel of Harlem,&#148; &#147;Trash,
        Trampoline and the Party Girl&#148; from &#147;A
        Celebration.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&gt;&gt; With Rob Zombie just
        now feeling some success from his new solo project,
        &#147;Hellbilly Deluxe,&#148; White Zombie has officially
        thrown in the towel. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The band called it quits on
        Wednesday of last week, announcing that they would not
        record or perform together again. According to band
        members, it was a peaceful split and just something that
        had to happen. According to bassist Sean Yseult, the band
        had &#147;run its course.&#148; White Zombie survived
        thirteen years together as a band.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The band had been planning to
        start recording another album in January of 1999. Yseult
        says that there are no unreleased White Zombie songs
        waiting to be released and that fans won&#146;t be seeing
        the group reform for any special events.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Rob Zombie, the band&#146;s
        frontman, is just about to launch his own tour to support
        &#147;Hellbilly Deluxe.&#148; Accompanying Zombie on the
        road will be White Zombie drummer, John Tempestra, who
        played drums on the album. Yseult is going to be giving
        most of her attention to her surf band, Famous Monsters,
        whose debut album, &#147;In The Night&#148;, will hit
        stores on October 20.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&gt;&gt; If you have not picked
        up the new album by Marilyn Manson, go get it now. This
        album is a masterpiece. Manson has made the switch from
        creepy guy to great artist with ease. Marilyn Manson&#146;s
        &#147;Mechanical Animals&#148; will hit the top of &#147;Billboard&#148;
        charts this week after selling just about 223,000 copies
        in its first week in stores. A world tour is soon to
        follow, but not much has been finalized as of yet.</strong></font></p>
