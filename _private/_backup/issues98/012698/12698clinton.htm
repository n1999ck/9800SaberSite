        <td><font size="4">President Bill Clinton was once again
        accused of sexual misconduct Wednesday. </font><p><font size="4">Whitewater Independent counsel Kenneth Starr
        requested to expand his probe to include the allegations
        that Clinton conspired to coerce a White House intern,
        Monica Lewinsky, to lie in the</font><font size="5"><img src="12698lewinsky.jpg" alt="Former Whit House Aide, Monica Lewinsky" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="200" height="233"></font><font size="4"> Paula Jones trial
        coming up in May.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">A three judge appeals court panel
        authorized Starr to expand his investigation. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Starr was prompted to expand the
        investigation after a series of tapes made over a period
        of 18 months by another former White House aide and
        friend of Lewinsky, Linda Tripp, were brought to his
        attention.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">On Tuesday, January 13 FBI agents
        working for Starr wired Tripp before she met Lewinsky for
        drinks at the Ritz.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">According to reports from ABC and the
        Washington Post, the tapes included detailed descriptions
        of an on going affair between Lewinsky and the president
        and allegations that Clinton asked her to lie about the
        affair. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">One source who has listened to the
        tapes told CNN that Lewinsky told Tripp the president
        said to her, &#147;There is no evidence, so you can deny,
        deny, deny.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Reporters who have listened to the
        tapes say they also include comments by Lewinsky that <!--webbot bot="ImageMap" rectangle="(15,269) (234,294) mailto:saber@colstate.edu" src="Reader_Poll2.JPG" align="left" border="0" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="250" height="300" startspan --><MAP NAME="FrontPageMap"><AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="15, 269, 234, 294" HREF="mailto:saber@colstate.edu"></MAP><a href="../../../../../_vti_bin/shtml.dll/Old_saber_site/_private/_backup/issues98/012698/12698clinton.htm/map"><img src="Reader_Poll2.JPG" align="left" border="0" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="250" height="300" ismap usemap="#FrontPageMap"></a><!--webbot bot="ImageMap" endspan i-checksum="24801" --></font><font size="4">Vernon
        Jordan, close friend to the president, asked her to lie
        about her relationship with president Clinton in the
        Jones trial.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">Jordan adamantly denied
        the accusations at a press conference Wednesday.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">On January 7, before the tapes
        surfaced, Lewinsky gave a sworn affidavit in connection
        with Jones case. The Post reported its sources said
        Lewinsky denied the affair in the affidavit.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">During an interview on the PBS program
        &#147;NewsHour&#148; Clinton said, &#147;There was no
        improper relationship . . .&#148; When asked to explain
        what he meant by &#147;improper relationship&#148; he
        answered, &#147;I think you know what it means. It means
        there was no sexual-improper sexual relationship or any
        improper relationship . . .&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Late Wednesday afternoon Starr and
        Jones&#146; attorneys subpoenaed White House documents
        including custodial records, logs, employment records and
        documents relating to Lewinsky. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Starr also asked for White House logs
        that would show how often Lewinsky visited the West Wing
        of the White House and telephone records to show if
        Lewinsky called the president or if he called her. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Lewinsky began her unpaid internship in
        the White House at age 21 in the summer 1995. She was
        hired in December 1995 as a staff assistant in the Office
        of Legislature Affairs, where she sometimes delivered
        correspondence to the Oval Office. </font></p>
