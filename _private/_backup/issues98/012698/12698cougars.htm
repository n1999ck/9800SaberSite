        <td><font size="4">The Columbus State men&#146;s
        basketball team continued it&#146;s dominance over
        it&#146;s competitors and in the process, took over first
        place and helped it&#146;s coach reach another milestone
        in his legendary career.</font><p><font size="4">With a
        first place showdown on the horizon, the Columbus State
        Cougars knew they had to keep their heads straight in
        order to prevent being upset by the 7-9 Armstrong
        Atlantic Pirates. The win would have to come amid the
        excitement of head coach Herbert Greene gunning for his
        300th victory at CSU and in front a season-high crowd of
        1,415 at Woodruff Gym. The Cougars were not to be denied.
        Columbus was led by senior Larry Coates who scored a game
        high 21 points. CSU also got key playing from Calvin Hill
        who returned to the lineup after a one game suspension.
        The win gave Columbus State it&#146;s best 17 game start
        in school history at 14-3.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The Cougars weren&#146;t through
        however. After disposing of Armstrong Atlantic and non
        conference Morehouse, Columbus took dead aim on the
        Bobcats from Georgia College &amp; State University.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The Cougar vs. Bobcat matchup pitted
        the first and second place teams in the Peach Belt
        Conference against each other for the first time this
        season. At 9-6, Georgia College promised to be a stiff
        challenge for the first place Cougars. After being down
        by six at halftime, Columbus State used the ice cold
        shooting of Georgia College as a spring board to leap in
        front of the Bobcats and cruise to a 70-61 victory. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The Columbus victory brought the
        Cougars record to 16-3, 6-1 in the Peach Belt. Columbus
        was ranked 20th in the national poll and now has a two
        game lead in the Peach Belt Conference.</font></p>
