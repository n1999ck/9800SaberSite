    <td><font size="4">President Clinton is yet again caught in the midst of a sex scandal.
    This time he is accused of having an affair with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky,
    who was due to testify in the Paula Jones case. </font><p><font size="4">If people were
    having a difficult time believing accusations by Paula Jones, it is getting more difficult
    to believe President Clinton&#146;s evasive answers to some very straight forward
    questions in the Lewinsky scandal. One thing that remains consistent is the
    President&#146;s waning credibility.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">As a woman, I wonder if Paula Jones is doing more harm than good for
    women. Her credibility is shaky if only on the grounds that she waited so long to come
    forward. Any collective feeling by the public or those in Washington, that Clinton is a
    faithful husband is history. However, the question remains, why did Jones wait so long to
    be so terribly offended by the President&#146;s alleged actions. She took five years to be
    offended. It is possible that she is now motivated by greed. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">If Jones was motivated by greed, why then should we believe
    Lewinsky&#146;s allegations? After all, she didn&#146;t even come forward herself, but was
    asked to give a deposition in the Jones case. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">What makes Lewinsky&#146;s allegations so believable is not what
    she&#146;s saying, but what Clinton is not saying. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">When asked by a PBS reporter on the program &#147;NewsHour&#148; shortly
    after the story came out, Clinton said, &#147;There was no improper relationship&#148;.
    When the interviewer asked him to further explain his statement he said, &#147;There was
    no sexual-improper sexual relationship or any improper relationship at all.&#148; He could
    have given the interviewer a flat, &#147;No&#148; or even told him it was none of his
    business. Instead, he choose a very carefully worded and slightly ambiguous response.
    After all, the term &#147;improper&#148; is relative and fairly subjective. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">Clinton was not the only one giving answers that prompted more questions
    during the early hours of the scandal. White House Press Secretary, Mike McCurry, refused
    to comment beyond the statement that the President had no improper relationship with
    Lewinsky. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">Chief White House Correspondent, Sam Donaldson, said on
    &#147;Dateline&#148; that he wondered why Clinton chose not to simply answer questions
    with yes or no. In other words, why choose words that do not flatly deny he had sex with
    Lewinsky?</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">If Clinton is innocent the matter would be less complicated. He could
    answer questions unequivocally. The problem with being woken up in the predawn hours to
    accusations of sexual misconduct is, there is no time to see the other player&#146;s hand.
    Before deciding on answers to the press&#146; question. His advisors did not necessarily
    have to know the truth, but they had to know what evidence the other side had against the
    President to avoid later problems.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">Clinton finally did deny any sexual contact with Lewinsky. His answers
    were shorter and more believable. Maybe because they were true, but maybe because he was
    confident the evidence was not available to prove otherwise. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">The President has other evidence piling up against him. Including tapes
    which reportedly include conversation between Lewinsky and White House employee, Tripp,
    discussing the alleged affair. &#147;Newsweek&#148; reported that Lewinsky told Tripp the
    President had sent his long time friend, Jordan, to convince her to deny the affair. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">Unlike Clinton&#146;s wishy washy answers to allegations, Jordan
    blatantly denies he ever suggested to Lewinsky that she lie. This is an even more serious
    allegation that the original because it is a federal offense to tamper with witnesses due
    to testify in a federal investigation.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">In light of the White House staff&#146;s difficulty producing recorders
    that disprove allegations that Lewinsky entered the White House in the late hours of the
    night and lack of denial that Clinton presented Lewinsky with gifts, Clinton seems to be
    less and less credible with ever breaking news report. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">His admission during the Jones deposition that he had an affair with
    Gennifer Flowers, which he had previously denied, did not help matters either. According
    to reports from &#147;Dateline&#148;, others in Washington, both Democrats and Republicans
    are keeping quiet about the scandal. Cokie Roberts said on the broadcast that she heard
    many people say they hoped it wasn&#146;t true, but felt it was. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">With power of the Presidency being what it is, in the end we may never
    know the whole truth of either the Jones or the Lewinsky allegations. Perhaps more
    importantly, we may never know the truth behind the accusations involving Jordan. Like the
    Kennedy assassination , Watergate and even the Whitewater scandal, it is doubtful that
    even in the light of new evidence, that everyone will ever agree on exactly what is true
    and what is fiction in this case.</font></td>
