        <td><font size="4">Career Expo &#145;98 is coming to
        Columbus State University. It will be on January 30 in
        Woodruff Gymnasium. This year the expo will have over
        ninety five employers from the surrounding region. CSU is
        co hosting the expo with Georgia Southwestern University
        and Columbus Technical Institute. Several companies from
        around town help sponsor the event including Tom&#146;s,
        Powertel, and many more. </font><p><font size="4">The
        employers scheduled to come are a very diverse group.
        Some of the employers coming are WTVM Channel 9, AFLAC,
        Coco-Cola, Quad/ Graphics, and Synovus.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The day will begin at 7:30 a.m. with
        early registration and a continental breakfast. At 8:15
        Dr. Robert Johnson, the Dean of the Abbott Turner College
        of Business, will give a speech on teamwork. After the
        speech from Dr. Johnson there will be an hour for
        businesses to set up booths. Beginning at ten the expo
        will let students, alumni, staff and people from the
        community visit tables.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Everyone attending the expo must
        register. Christi Dixon said that it is not necessary to
        be there at 10:00 a.m. to participate. If you have an
        early morning class you have time to meet the employers.
        They will be interviewing until 1:00 p.m.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">If you think that meeting employers is
        all Career Expo is about you are wrong. After meeting
        employers there are workshops held in the afternoon.
        Beginning at 2:00 there is a Panel Presentation in
        Davidson Auditorium where representatives from large
        organizations discuss what they look for in interviews.
        Then there will be a one-on-one mock interview with one
        of the employers.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The Career Center is expecting about
        1500 participants. Christi Dixon from the Career Center
        said &#147;It&#146;s open to all students, and all
        students are encouraged to attend to begin a job
        search.&#148; Dixon wanted to encourage all students to
        attend not just Seniors. &#147;Freshman, Sophomore, and
        Juniors are encouraged to come to ask questions and to
        network. It helps to see what opportunities are open for
        that field,&#148; said Dixon.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Dixon also strongly encourages those
        almost ready to graduate. Dixon said &#147;students
        getting ready to graduate are expected to dress
        professionally and bring a lot of resumes.&#148; Dixon
        maintains that this is a great opportunity for the
        students to get to know what is available in our area.
        &#147;Never again will you ever have that many employers
        in one room,&#148; said Dixon.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Dixon summed up the expo by saying
        it&#146;s a &#147;huge, exciting, great event, and
        everyone should come.&#148;</font></p>
