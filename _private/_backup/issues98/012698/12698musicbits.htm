        are sure to make this week an exciting time in the music
        world. The awards show will be telecast live on Monday,
        January 26, 1998 from the Shrine Auditorium in Los
        Angeles, California. The show will air from 8:00 until
        11:00, and will be hosted by Drew Carey. The competition
        for awards includes Beck, Matchbox 20, Mariah Carey, Alan
        Jackson, U2, Puff Daddy, Bush, and many others.</font><p><font size="4">In addition to the regular awards will be a
        special &#147;Award of Merit&#148; that will go to Frank
        Sinatra for his many years and contributions to the music
        industry. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">In what seems to be a popular
        occurrence in the music industry today , the British
        publication, &#147;Dot Magazine&#148;, is reporting that
        we may see yet another reunion tour and album this
        summer. Boy George and The Culture Club may be planning a
        come-back that includes a world tour and possible new
        album. The band formed in 1981, and includes Boy George
        on vocals, Roy Hay on guitar, Mikey Craig on bass, and
        Jon Moss on drums. After a highly successful stint in the
        early 80&#146;s, the band broke up in 1986 due to drug
        and relationship scandals between Boy George and Jon
        Moss. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">It is unknown if the Culture Club,
        which made it to number one on the charts, with &#147;Do
        You Really Want To Hurt Me?&#148;, will include all
        original members this time around.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The four originals have all stayed in
        the music business in some fashion , but none have come
        close to reaching the success they achieved together as
        The Culture Club. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Falling right into line with the recent
        string of reunions in the music industry is the 80&#146;s
        rock band Ratt. Sony has recently signed the band to a
        new deal, and Ratt will go into the studio to start work
        on the new album this month. Vocalist Stephen Pearcy will
        join guitar player Warren DeMartini and drummer Bobby
        Blotzer on the new album, and will go on without bassist
        Juan Croucer and guitarist Robbin Crosby. Replacements
        for the departed members will be announcement after
        production of the album is underway. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Rounding out this weeks reunion news
        are two former members of the rock band Led Zeppelin.
        Robert Plant and Jimmy Page have announced that their new
        album will be available on March 17. The album is not yet
        titled, but a fifty city North American tour will follow
        this summer to support the new collaboration. Stevie
        Nicks, of Fleetwood Mac, has also started work on her new
        solo album. It will be out later this year, but her new
        box set is due out this March. The box set is titled
        &#147;Edge of 17&#148;, and a summer tour is planned to
        support the box set. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">For those of you that are looking for
        some new music to listen to, I have a few suggestions.
        Former Pearl Jam drummer Dave Abbruzzese has a new band
        called The Green Romance Orchestra. Their new album,
        &#147;Plays Parts I and V&#148; is in stores now. Fans of
        the band The Cure will enjoy their new singles collection
        titled &#147;Galore&#148;.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">It covers all of the bands singles from
        1987 to 1997. Barenaked Ladies have a live album in
        stores now. The album, &#147;Rock Spectacle&#148;, is
        taken from several shows performed in 1996 and is an
        excellent compilation. To round things out this week, Ben
        Folds Five have released a new album full of demo&#146;s
        and live versions of songs that are the personal
        favorites of the band. The album is titled &#147;Naked
        Baby Photos&#148;. </font></p>
