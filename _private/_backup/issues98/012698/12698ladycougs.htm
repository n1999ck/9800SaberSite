        story for the Columbus State Lady Cougars, face a tough
        opponent, stomp them into the ground, face an even
        tougher opponent, stomp them into the ground a little
        worse. In short, the Lady Cougars are consistently
        defeating quality opponents by huge point margins,
        margins that are causing many around the Peach Belt
        Conference to shutter at the thought of having to face
        off with Columbus State.</font><p><font size="4">The
        latest fatality on the Lady Cougars hit list was the
        Georgia College &amp; State University Lady Bobcats.
        Georgia College entered the game in Milledgeville in
        second place behind Columbus with an impressive 11-3
        record. The Lady Cougars had an equally impressive 12-3
        record and were undefeated in Peach Belt play. The game
        promised to be a closely fought battle, and it was, that
        is until the Lady Cougars exploded on a 21-0 run in the
        opening minutes of the game. The score was 10-11 when
        Columbus shot their play into high gear. Once the nets
        had cooled down the score was 39-12. From their the Lady
        Cougars never looked back as they defeated Georgia
        College 107-86. Columbus was led by Toschia
        Campfield&#146;s 26 points and Que Gilliam&#146;s 25
        points.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The Lady Cougars raised their record to
        13-3 and 7-0 in the Peach Belt Conference. Earlier in the
        week Columbus State defeated Armstrong Atlantic 90-52.
        The victory over Georgia College marked the fifth game in
        a row that Columbus has won by 20 points or more.</font></p>
