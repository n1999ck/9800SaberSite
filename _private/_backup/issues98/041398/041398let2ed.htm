    <td><font size="4"><strong>This letter is in response to the letter from &#147;A Concerned
    Student&#148; printed in your ROAR! Column April 6. This student voiced three complaints,
    which I would like to address.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>The first
    complaint regards the quality of the lunches versus the dinners. Their complaint is that
    the lunches are better than the dinners because &#147;there are less people of importance
    ... who eat dinner than lunch.&#148; I agree that the lunches are better than the dinners,
    but it has nothing to do with the &#147;importance&#148; of the people who eat lunch
    versus dinner. The dinner menu, is comparable to those menus of other college foodservice
    programs, while the lunch menu at CSU far exceeds the quality (and cost) of many other
    college foodservice programs. This increase in quality is in effect to attract some of the
    students, Staff &amp; Faculty who would otherwise go elsewhere for their lunch. Besides
    this, we already have updated the cycle menu for this spring quarter, and have made
    improvements to the dinner menu.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>The second complaint was that there are more service lines for
    lunch than there are for dinner. Again this is correct. The fact is that we serve about
    350 people each lunch and less than 200 each dinner. The service lines&#146; issue is more
    an issue of supply &amp; demand. When we only have the Grill &amp; Cafe Features line
    open, due to someone being out, we still offer the full Deli Corner menu at the grill. We
    have also increased the amount of pizzas that we are prepping so that we have more pizzas
    for the dinner meal.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>The third complaint is a valid one. Before opening this quarter,
    my staff &amp; I had a 6 hour employee meeting, with over 2 hours pertaining to Safety
    &amp; Sanitation policies. We discussed the importance of wearing gloves, and I stressed
    that if anyone is handling food, they MUST have gloves on, or they will be written up. We
    have recently put in a surveillance system to be able to be more aware of these
    situations. I agree with this student that this is not acceptable behavior.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><strong>I appreciate the concerns showed by &#147;A Concerned
    Student&#148; as I am always trying to improve customer service. My door is always open,
    and I appreciate the candor. Any suggestions, comments, or complaints are welcome. This
    invitation goes out to all customers, meal plan or not.</strong></font></p>
