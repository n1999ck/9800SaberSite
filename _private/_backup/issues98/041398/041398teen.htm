        <td><font size="4"><strong>On April 10, a California
        appeals court unanimously ruled that teenagers have no
        constitutional right to have sex.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>The court upheld a lower juvenile court
        ruling that said the right to privacy does not include
        sex, even consensual, between minors.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>A 16 year old boy in Alameda
        County, California was arrested and charged with rape
        after having sex with his 14 year old girlfriend, who
        consented to the act.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The boy challenged the arrest
        as unconstitutional on the grounds that sex is a
        fundamental right covered by privacy laws that apply to
        minors as well as adults.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Lawyers for the boy argued that
        the statutory rape laws are in place in order to protect
        minors from adult perpetrators. The argued that in this
        case, the two minors were both consenting and therefore,
        neither should be penalized by law.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Justice Ignazio Ruvolo wrote in
        the court&#146;s opinion, &#147;There are freedoms which
        adults enjoy which are beyond those afforded minors.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The court ruled that while the
        reality is that many California teenagers are sexually
        active, that fact does not mean that minors have a right
        to privacy to engage in sexual intercourse. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Earlier court rulings have been
        overturned, which would have required parental consent
        for minors to have abortions. However, in this the court
        says this earlier ruling does not give minors behave as
        they like sexually.<br>
        The lower court&#146;s decision to put the boy on
        probation was upheld. </strong></font></p>
