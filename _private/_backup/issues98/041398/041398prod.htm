        student, Brea Vaughan will be playing the wicked
        stepmother in the Academy of Fine Arts&#146; presentation
        of &#147;Cinderella&#148; on May 17 at 2:30 p.m. at the
        Three Arts Theatre. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Vaughan
        is a marketing student at CSU and has been a teacher at
        the Academy of Fine Arts&#146; for the past 6 years. She
        has been taking dance since she was four years old.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Vaughan says, &#147;I was Snow
        White a couple of years ago. This time I&#146;m playing
        the stepmother. It&#146;s fun to be someone I&#146;m not.&#148;
        </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The production is an adaptation
        by Patty Taylor, the director of the academy. Taylor will
        be directing the production, which will include a large
        cast of local children and adults from the community.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>This adaptation of the
        Cinderella story is a combination of the Disney
        Cinderella story and the ballet version of the story. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The performance features a
        special portion devoted to popular modern jazz. There
        will also be a tribute to television and 50 teens and
        adults will dance to rock music in the production. CSU&#146;s
        Brantley Arrington will also fill the role of the Prince.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The costumes, made by Linda
        Hall, are elaborate and fun, according to Vaughan. </strong></font></p>

        available at the Academy now by calling 561-8085 or will
        be available at the box office before each performance.
