        tradition begins</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>by
        Heather Warren / Associate Editor</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><img src="020298/020298homecoming.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="280" height="155"></font><font size="4">Columbus State
        University begins what some students hope will become a
        tradition. Winterfest was the title of the week which ran
        from Tuesday, January 20 until Saturday, January 24. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Lei Paulding, Secretary of Student
        Government Assoc-iation says, &#147;I think it was a
        great success and will get better every year.&#148; </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The Winterfest basketball homecoming
        celebration began with a Pep Rally and cookout that was
        sponsored by Student Government Association (SGA) and the
        cheerleaders. There were free hot dogs and the
        cheerleaders were there get everyone in the spirit. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">All week long there was a &#147;find
        the cougar contest&#148;, in which students received
        clues via e-mail regarding the location of the cougar.
        The cougar was found on Thursday by CSU Housing
        Authority. The hiding place was in the Tower Center in an
        office stuffed under a lamp. Linda Hurst, president of
        the SGA, hid the cougar. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Part of the festivites included a
        homecoming court with king and queen to be crowned at the
        end of the week. The court consisted of representatives
        from the organizations that were participating in the
        homecoming activities. The couple that volunteered the
        most at 30th Avenue Elementary and who raised the most
        money for the Special Olympics were awarded the titles
        King and Queen. The King and Queen of homecoming week
        were Jeff Battles and Jamie Smith who represented Sigma
        Nu. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">On Wednesday the Talent Show, which was
        sponsored by Student Programming Council (SPC), was held
        in the Davidson Auditorium. The winner was Kelli Howard
        and second place went to Andy Manuel. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Thursday was Island Fest at the Gym
        Annex. The Island Fest consisted of what one student
        referred to as &#147;goofy&#148; games. Participants
        played games such as, the balloon relay and bat spin. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">As the end of the week approached more
        activities were scheduled for the two remaining days. On
        Friday, the Winterfest Parade was held. F ollowing the
        parade was the homecoming pep rally and band party. The
        band present at the party was DSOS. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The final day was Saturday, which
        consisted of an Old Timers Game, CSU women vs Kennesaw
        State University game and CSU Men vs Kennesaw State
        University game. The evening concluded with a Winterfest
        Ball at the Bradley Theater.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The homecoming court raised $1696.49 to
        go to the Special Olympics. The money was raised in
        various ways ranging from producing t-shirts to raffling
        off televisions. The check was presented to Public Safety
        and they will send representatives to Atlanta for the
        1998 Law Enforcement Torch Run.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Although, most students thought
        homecoming was an overall success a few students had some
        suggestions to give. A student who wished to remain
        unnamed says, &#147;It&#146;s a great idea, I&#146;m glad
        we&#146;re starting traditions on campus but it needs
        more organization and student support.&#148; </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Another student who wished to remain
        anonymous says, &#147;although, bringing group
        organizations together was the overall theme the
        organizers may want to revamp the program to better
        include many of the smaller organizations.&#148; </font></p>
