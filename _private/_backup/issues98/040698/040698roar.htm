        am writing this document so that it may serve as a wakeup
        call for CSU&#146;s cafeteria service. I am currently a
        junior who has lived in the College Courtyard for 8
        quarters. For those of you who do not know, the students
        who live in the Courtyard are required to be on a meal
        plan with the cafeteria. Students have a choice between a
        two or three meal-a-day plan. We pay a housing fee along
        with tuition, which includes the cost of the meal plan
        that is chosen. The point of me writing this document is
        to inform the cafeteria managers, students, faculty and
        staff of the many complaints that several of the meal
        plan students have about our cafeteria services:</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>The first complaint is that the lunches
        that are served are much better than the dinners that are
        served. I am sure that many of the Courtyard residents
        notice this, because we are the ones who eat both lunch
        and dinner. in this statement, I am trying to convey the
        fact that there are less people of &#147;importance&#148;
        on the campus who eat dinner than lunch. It is my belief
        that because there are fewer members of the faculty and
        staff who eat dinner, better meals are prepared for
        lunch. I do not think that this is fair to the students
        who pay their money and expect quality for payments that
        have been made. I will not go into the details of what is
        actually served, but I can say that many of the meals
        served for dinner have a lot to be desired. Many times,
        students walk out of the cafeteria with nothing but a
        drink in their hands because of the lack of quality of
        the meals that are prepared.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The next complaint that I have
        is about the service lines. Why are there only two of
        them open for dinner? People who eat dinner in the
        cafeteria can only get a meal from the main meal line,
        the grill, or sometimes the sandwich line. It would be
        much better for the students if all of the lines were
        open. This would give us a variety of items to choose
        from.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>My final complaint is about one
        of the cafeteria employees. This particular employee has
        very close contact with our food when she prepares it.
        For some reason, she does not wear gloves and I think
        that it is disgusting. I have walked over to her several
        times to be served, and have seen her eating in between
        serving customers. I do not think that this is sanitary
        or acceptable behavior.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I hope that these issues can be
        resolved or at least improved. If they are not resolved,
        at least more people are now aware of the complaints that
        frequent the minds of many students, especially those of
        us who are on the meal plan.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Sincerely,<br>
        A Concerned Student</strong></font></p>
