        recording, the 31 -year-old Texas native had been known
        to Nashville insiders as a local performer and songwriter
        who had collaborated with such heavyweights as Bill
        Anderson, Sam Hogin and Ed Hill.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Her debut, according to
        Billboard magazine, has drawn heavy airplay and stamped a
        distinctive style: &#147;Great voice, great songs ...
        Womack pays homage to country&#146;s rich tradition
        without sounding retro. She can handle hard-driving,
        truck-driving tunes, gospel songs, and tender ballads
        with equal aplomb.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Womack had attracted top-notch
        studio support in making the album: a duet with Mark
        Chestnut on &#147;Make Memories with Me,&#148; backing
        vocals by Ricky Skaggs and Sharon White on &#147;Never
        Again, Again&#148; (her first single) and &#147;Get Up in

        from Bob Dylan and Hank Williams to The Clash and the

        and the B-52s to out of the mid-80&#146;s Athen&#146;s
        -alternative&#148; scene to broadened recognition. The <img src="040698dc.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="200" height="200"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>1986
        debut Scarred but Smarter was a college-radio staple and
        catapulted them from a top Atlanta/Athens-club draw to
        extensive touring and major-label interest.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The emergence led to
        high-profile tours in 1989 &#151; co-headlining with Soul
        Asylum and as an opening act for REM&#146;s arena-sized
        &#147;Green Tour.&#148; Also, a guest appearance by
        R.E.M.&#146;s Peter Buck added to the group&#146;s third
        release, Mystery Road (1989).</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>A commercial peak may have
        occurred with 1991's gold-selling Fly Me Courageous. It
        spawned two videos (the title track and &#147;Build a
        Fire&#148;) as among MTV&#146;s most requested, and heavy
        airplay on rock radio. The success culminated on tour
        &#151; with legendary Nell Young and Seattle&#146;s Sonic
        Youth, prompting a live EP and home video, Live on Fire.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The group last summer released
        a seventh, self-titled album featuring another
        collaboration with R.E.M.&#146;s Buck (&#147;Passing
        Through&#148;) and a cover of John Denver&#146;s
        &#147;Leaving on a Jet Plane&#148; &#151; the first son-
        front man Kevin Kinney had learned to play, as a

        continues to preserve the Medallions&#146; 30-plus-year
        reign as &#147;the party band of the South.&#148; The
        Greenwood, SC-based act is commonly associated with beach
        music, rhythm and blues, frat rock or shaggin&#146;
        music.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The Medallions (including a
        four-piece horn section) feature a set list covering
        James Brown, the Four Tops, the Temptations, Tom Jones
        and other names synonymous with 60&#146;s pop/r&amp;b, in
