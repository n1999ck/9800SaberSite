        <td><font size="4"><strong>The entire Peach Belt Athletic
        Conference tournament was a success for Columbus State
        University (CSU). Along with the success of both men and
        women&#146;s basketball teams, two other
        &#147;teams&#148; were rewarded in Savannah. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>In the cheerleading competition,
        Columbus State finished second behind Georgia College
        &amp; State University who clinched their eighth title. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Also finishing second was the
        CSU Pep Band. The band, who is seen at most CSU
        basketball games, were also defeated by GC&amp;SU. The
        band performed a rather amusing segment where one member
        ran around shaking a tambourine, and flailing his arms,
        imitating a televangelist as the band played energetic
        gospel music.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>In winning the regular season
        and tournament championships, several CSU Cougars claimed
        awards. Senior point-guard Larry Coates was named the
        Peach Belt Athletic Conference Player of the Year,
        becoming the first Cougar to earn such an honor, and was
        named to the first All-PBAC team. Coates averaged 16.5
        points a game and tied the CSU record for assists in a
        season with 242. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Also receiving honors for the
        Cougars was senior Calvin Hill, who was named PBAC
        tournament MVP. Hill scored 53 points in the three Cougar
        games including 24 against Clayton State. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>On the women&#146;s side, after
        leading his team to a 22-4 record, 16-0 in the
        conference, head coach Jay Sparks was named as the Peach
        Belt Athletic Conference Coach of the Year. Sparks, who
        is in his ninth season at CSU also won the award in 1994.
        Also for the Lady Cougars, </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>seniors Que Gilliam and Toschia
        Campfield were named the to the first team All-PBAC
        squad. </strong></font></p>
