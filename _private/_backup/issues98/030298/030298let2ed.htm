        and to the attention of the entire student body a
        question, this is Georgia, Where is the southern
        hospitality? I am a new student here this quarter and I
        realize there are over 60 organizations to get involved
        with but some have rules and regulations. Also, not
        everyone feels comfortable joining an organization to get
        involved due to other school responsibilities. Therefore,
        where do the lonely people go? I realize many students
        have local friends or mates that they go out with but
        some have none.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I met a young lady the other
        day and she was sitting alone in the Davidson Center. I
        talked with her enough to know that she often sits there
        alone and depressed. She said that she tried to get
        involved with others but she had very little response.
        She also said she was a shy type person. This girl is in
        counseling and suffers with very low self-esteem. This is
        the most shameful thing I have ever heard. In a city this
        large, full of possibilities, and a person must sit
        alone. I know that some of the organizations here try to
        have entertainment such as dating games but not all
        people will participate because they are shy or reserved.
        Should these people remain alone, sad, and depressed
        their entire college life? Here at college, classmates do
        not get the chance to really know each other and it is
        easy to see why this cycle takes place. But, it needs
        attention because it does not have to be this way. I have
        an idea that I would like to see take effect here. Some
        of the organizations of the school or a new one perhaps
        should create a &#147;make-a-friend night&#148; so that
        all the students could gather together for a movie and
        refreshments at least once a week in the Davidson center.
        I also feel that someone such as a &#147;mixer&#148;
        should see that even the shy people join in. People could
        make friends and possible dates. What do you think?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>It is a shame to see anyone
        alone in a would full of people. There is also no excuse
        in it. People who are happy should share in their
        happiness to help make other people happy. Please see to
        it that the campus is made aware of the lonely, somewhere
        out there!</strong></font></p>
