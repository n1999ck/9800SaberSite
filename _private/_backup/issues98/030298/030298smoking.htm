        <td><font size="4"><strong>Smoking is a hot topic on
        campus these days. The issue is not whether people should
        smoke or not, it is the matter of the regulations
        regarding smoking and the controversy it causes when some
        do not know the rules. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>There
        is a relatively new rule on campus that requires persons
        to be at least 20 feet from any building to smoke. The
        rule was signed into effect by Dr. Brown around five
        months ago, according to Public Safety officials. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The rule is new and not well
        known around campus. There are signs regarding smoking.
        One warning on various signs posted reads &#147;please
        extinguish smoking materials here. &#147; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The Davidson building has a
        similar sign about five feet away from the building. The
        Davidson building and other buildings have ashtrays about
        five feet away from the door. </strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4"><strong><img src="030298smoker.jpg" align="left" hspace="0" width="204" height="325"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>Howard
        Hall and the Fine Arts Hall both have signs which
        discourage smoking near entrances, but ashtrays are
        available within 20 feet. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The smoking policy in the
        1997-1998 Columbus State University Handbook states that
        &#147;Smoking is prohibited in all buildings on
        campus.&#148; Student Government Association and the
        Public Safety say the rule is no smoking in campus
        buildings and no smoking within twenty feet of a campus
        building. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Officer Enrique Degracia says
        he has only had to ask one or two students to step away
        from the doorway. &#147;I feel that most everyone
        complies,&#148; says Degracia.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Linda Hurst, president of
        Student Government Association, says that she feels very
        discriminated against, &#147;If the law is written down
        it should be enforced and it is not being enforce.&#148;
        However, Hurst feels the policy should not exist. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;I can understand them not
        wanting us to smoke inside,&#148; Hurst says, but she
        feels restricting outside smoking is not necessary.
        &#147;It is bad enough we have to stand in the cold or
        the heat. I don&#146;t see how they can say we have to
        stand away from the building,&#148; says Hurst. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>This brings up the issue of the
        gazebos. Many smokers complain that the gazebos, which
        reportedly cost around $5000.00 each, leak. Hurst says
        the gazebos were put in place primarily for the use of
        smokers but not exclusively so. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Hurst says that Public Safety
        can not enforce the rule. She says that all they can do
        is ask people to step away from the door.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>One student who wishes not to
        be named says, &#147;I feel one person&#146;s rights end
        where another&#146;s begin. It is uncomfortable to have
        to walk through a cloud of smoke. I understand that
        smokers feel discriminated against but some people, like
        myself, have allergies or asthma and could avoid a great
        deal of discomfort by smokers simply stepping away from
        the doors that everyone must enter.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Despite the controversy about
        smoking on campus, one thing is clear: the rules are
        difficult to sort out and confusing to both smokers and
        non-smokers.</strong></font></p>
