        professors? I have a friend that has had many family and
        financial problems this quarter yet he has still made
        every effort to attend class as much as possible and to
        keep up with the work. This friend also recently had
        another friend that committed suicide in his home town.
        As you can see this person could use a break. So he tried
        to continue his classes only to have his professors
        refuse to work with him and even ask him to withdraw. Why
        should he have to if he has a chance to pass? I know in
        some cases the student may make excuses for laziness but
        not all students do. The professor could take the time to
        talk to and research the student. I think professors need
        to remember that students are human and sometimes bad
        events happen out of their control. We should still have
        a chance to catch our breath and pass our classes. Under
        certain circumstances they shouldn&#146;t make it any
        harder than it already is.</strong></font></td>
