        <td><font size="4"><strong>Every few years, a new study
        is done to look into the possibility of a daycare program
        at CSU. Now that the percentage of non-traditional
        students is at an estimated 45%, the subject has been
        brought up again.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Army
        Captain candidates who ran the SGA about fifteen years
        ago started a childcare program. They helped renovate a
        house on Sellers Circle where they installed child-sized
        toilets and other necessities to get it started. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;At first the program ran
        fine because there weren&#146;t any outside daycare
        programs,&#148; said Larry Kees, Asst. Vice President for
        Student Affairs. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>After a few years daycares
        began springing up everywhere and the College program
        began to dwindle. Fewer people were bringing their
        children and the price was about the same as the other
        daycares so the College abandoned the program. Also, the
        facility was supposed to be self-supporting but the
        college ended up supplementing the daycare by thousands
        of dollars. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>CSU has one of the largest
        populations of non-traditional students in the Southeast
        and the average student age is 26. Because of this, we
        are in more need of a childcare facility now than ever
        before. The problems stem from the lack of space and
        money but are also due to the licensing and
        certifications required by the State. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;The best idea would be to
        have a private facility move or build adjacent to
        campus,&#148; said Kees. Privatization seems to be the
        current answer to some of the areas on campus like
        housing and the cafeteria. It is cheaper to have a
        company who specializes in a certain field to take charge
        of facilities and be responsible for regulations and
        codes. The case would be the same for childcare. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;Years ago, we had to
        serve a lot of masters like the local and state Fire
        Marshals and Health Department,&#148; said Kees. But
        after all the horror stories about daycares, the State
        has many licenses, laws and codes to be met which would
        be costly to CSU.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Augusta State University (ASU)
        and CSU are about the same size and have a similar
        student body demographic. A representative of their
        school said they have had a daycare for quite some time
        but, if they had it to do over again, they would never
        have begun the program. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The ASU daycare facility is
        located in an older building on campus and is funded by
        student activity fees. The cost of running the program is
        about $45,000 per year, which does not include the rent
        or the utility bills. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>ASU students want to take their
        children there for the full day, which was a problem at
        the CSU daycare also. According to State regulations it
        is illegal to keep the children the full day because the
        daycare cannot provide a hot meal.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Some people think the
        Department of Education could use a daycare as a study
        program but the Department cannot help with the funding
        and the State maintains that workers must be certified. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Others think that if CSU can
        afford to build a gym, they should be willing to have a
        daycare also. The construction of the gym is being funded
        by the State&#146;s money, a daycare would have to be
        funded from limited Student Activity fees.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>In a few more years, the
        question of a daycare will come up again and the same
        answers will be given. If CSU wants the program, it will
        be best to build a new facility and have it run by a
        private organization. In the meantime, don&#146;t take
        your kids to class with you because it&#146;s against
        policy. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Maybe one day La Petite or the
        Growing Room will be affiliated with the campus and the
        need for day care will be met.</strong></font></p>
