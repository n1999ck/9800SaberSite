        Columbus State Lady Cougars rolled into Savannah as the
        team to beat in the Peach Belt Conference Tournament.
        After all, they were 16-0 against Peach Belt teams during
        the season, had easily taken the regular season title,
        and were the number one seed team. The Lady Cougars had a
        great big bulls-eye on their backs and everyone was
        gunning for them.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>The
        Lady Cougars faced off with the Armstrong Atlantic Lady
        Pirates to begin their tournament run. CSU played
        sluggishly for most of the first half and shot an icy
        1-12 over a six minute stretch. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Columbus went on a crucial 9-2
        run late in the half and took a 35-34 lead into the
        locker room. The Lady Cougars dominated the second half
        as their pressure defense began to wear down Armstrong.
        Columbus forced the Lady Pirates into 31 turnovers in the
        game. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Sylvia Allen took charge in the
        second half and scored nine of her game high 14 points in
        the second half. Senior Que Gilliam added 12 points in
        the 81-71 victory.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The Lady Cougars moved on to
        face the Augusta State Lady Jaguars in the semi-final
        matchup, a game which turned into one of the most amazing
        comeback victories in school history. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The Lady Cougars could never
        get their game on track and appeared on their way to a
        heartbreaking loss. Columbus was held to 36 percent
        shooting and found themselves down by nine, 42-33, at the
        half. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The second half opened with the
        Lady Jaguars still dominating and leading by 21 points at
        one point. Augusta led by 17 points with just over four
        minutes to play, and that&#146;s when all hell broke
        loose for the Lady Jaguars. Augusta found several of
        it&#146;s top offensive weapons in serious foul trouble
        and they had to be benched. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>While the Lady Jaguars were
        falling apart at the seams, Columbus State was fighting
        back. After realizing the threes weren&#146;t falling,
        the Lady Cougars went to the inside. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Gilliam scored 10 points in
        only a minute to cut the Lady Jaguar lead to eight with
        two minutes to play. Columbus&#146; defense held Augusta
        scoreless for the games final 2:40. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>After cutting the lead to six,
        Reagan Housch nailed a three pointer to make the score
        86-83. CSU forced a turnover and pushed the ball down the
        court. A three point attempt by Housch was partially
        blocked but the defender was called for a foul with just
        31 ticks remaining on the clock. Housch found herself at
        the free throw line shooting three free throws. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>After converting on the first
        two to pull CSU within one point, Housch, after
        withstanding an Augusta timeout, calmly sank the game
        tying bucket to send the game into overtime. The overtime
        period saw Columbus State complete it&#146;s unbelievable
        comeback by taking the lead and holding on for an
        improbable 97-96 victory.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The shocking win advanced CSU
        into the championship game against the 11th ranked
        Patriots of Francis Marion. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Francis Marion boasted a 26-2
        record and only one loss in the conference, that loss
        came at the hands of Columbus State. Francis Marion led
        the whole game and held off another Lady Cougar rally to
        take a 71-67 victory. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Toshcia Campfield was held to a
        season-low two points and the Patriots mastered a full
        court press which caused an average of 25 turnovers. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The loss ended the Lady Cougars
        18-game conference unbeaten streak. Despite the loss the
        Lady Cougars are still hopeful of an NCAA tournament bid.</strong></font></p>
