        <td><font size="4"><strong>This year, the Kappa Sigma
        Fraternity at CSU has taken on the lofty challenge of
        assisting the city of Columbus in as many ways as
        possible.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Kappa
        Sigma has long been a leader on campus and in the
        Columbus community for providing activities for the
        citizens of Columbus, but now, more than ever, these men
        are showing the people of Columbus, Georgia what they are
        made of.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Since fall quarter of 97&#146;,
        the members of Kappa Sigma have put in well over 140
        hours of community service helping organizations such as
        the Ronald McDonald House, St. Mark United Methodist
        Church, Columbus State&#146;s Halloween Carnival, Help
        the Hooch, and projects at 30th Avenue School, just to
        name a few.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Recently, several brothers
        spent a Saturday morning cleaning up a one mile stretch
        of road along Manchester Expressway through the
        adopt-a-mile program. The program is sponsored through
        the Keep Columbus Beautiful Commission, a bureau
        who&#146;s efforts are designed to </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>keep the streets and highways
        of Columbus clean. The brothers of Kappa Sigma have a
        designated area on Manchester Expressway, just past the
        Warm Springs Connector. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Philantropy Chairman, Kevin
        Breemes, stated, &#147;We take great pride in helping the
        community. So many people have a false impression of what
        fraternities are all about, and we are hoping that
        through our efforts the community can have a chance to
        see that Kappa Sigma is very community oriented, and our
        activities go far beyond that of others.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Along with it&#146;s activities
        in the community, the brothers of Kappa Sigma still
        manage to find the time to take part in campus activities
        and several members hold high positions in other
        organizations on campus. Just over a year old, the Kappa
        Sigma fraternity is well on it&#146;s way to a successful
        future at Columbus State University.</strong></font></p>
