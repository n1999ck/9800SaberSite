        <td><font size="4"><strong>Last week a 5 year old boy was
        charged with sexual harassment in Huntsville, Alabama. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>The boy, Christian Mills, was initially
        suspended from school for one day after being charged
        with the offense.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Later, school officials changed
        the charge to a more generic violation, but the one day
        suspension stood. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The boy allegedly exposed
        himself to another student in the restroom. However, his
        mother says he has been having trouble using the toilet
        on his own, fell over, and stood up before covering
        himself.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The important issue here is not
        whether or not the boy intentionally exposed himself, but
        how the school administration handled the situation.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>As a woman, I am fortunate to
        live in an era where I do not have to worry about being
        chased around a desk by my boss. It still happens, but at
        least now there are more channels to deal with this sort
        of harassment and stop it. I&#146;m grateful that women
        before me stood up and demanded the right to work in
        harassment free environments, often sacrificing their own
        jobs or reputation in the process.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>However, it has gone too far.
        We have reached a state of absolute paranoia. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The school administrations
        reaction to the common and normal act of this child, is
        not only overkill, but dangerous. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Children at 5 years old are
        just coming to understand their bodies. Most of us
        remember being curious about the body and remember
        wanting to share our new found knowledge with others. At
        5 years old the body is a new frontier, not tool of power
        or domination. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Power and domination is what
        sexual harassment is about, not body parts and dirty
        jokes. It is the meaning behind the act, the intent. It
        is hard for me to believe that many kindergarten children
        are capable of such intent. It is possible that there are
        children who are malicious in these sort of acts, but
        there is no evidence of that here.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>What there is evidence of here
        is a school&#146;s attempt to appease an ever growing
        group of radicals who believe any act involving sex or
        sexuality is an overt attempt to harm someone else. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The school had an opportunity
        to do the right thing. The administration could have
        talked to the boy, ask him not to expose himself and left
        it at that . Instead, a statement had to be made at the
        expense of this child&#146;s self esteem. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I wonder if the effects of this
        will follow this him throughout his life. It makes me sad
        that as a society we are so quick to label our children
        as perverted, bad or sexual deviants for engaging in
        things which for us as children were considered just a
        part of growing up. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>This child will have to suffer
        through being tagged a sexual harasser for what we once
        simply referred to as, &#147;I&#146;ll show you mine, if
        you show me yours&#148;. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The danger is not in the
        children, the danger is in pronouncing them criminals.</strong></font></p>
