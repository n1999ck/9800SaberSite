        <td><font size="4"><strong>One of many outstanding
        students attending Columbus State University is freshman
        Sophia Karlsson. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>She
        is currently on a sports scholarship that pays for room,
        board, and tuition. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Karlsson, 20, arrived here in
        September after graduating from a Swedish high school in
        June. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Ranked eighth in her country
        for her age group, she is participating in tennis at CSU
        and will play doubles in her first match with a fellow
        Swede. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;Playing with another
        Swede is great. We can talk to each other about the plays
        and no one else understands us,&#148; Karlsson says.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Karlsson is in her second
        quarter at CSU. She is taking a math class, English for
        international students, and theater appreciation. She is
        undecided in her major, but is considering psychology. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>She enjoys attending CSU but
        does not understand why people are often astonished that
        of all places in the United States, she chose here. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Being the last child to leave
        home, her parents miss her a lot. Sophia commented that
        they are very happy and proud of her for trying to
        accomplish her goals even though they want her home. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Karlsson e-mails her parents
        often and is able to talk on the phone with them once a
        week. Christmas break was the last time she saw her
        family and friends in Sweden. In March, her parents plan
        to visit her in Columbus. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Karlsson has had to adjust to
        some changes in the states as well. One thing is the
        climate. She said,&#148;In my country it is winter now
        and here it is nice out.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Food is another big change. At
        home she always ate a healthy meal prepared by her
        mother. Karlsson says,&#148;Here everybody eats fast food
        and nachos. There are fast-food restaurants everywhere.&#148;
        </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Another difference that
        Karlsson has dealt with is people saying &#147;hi&#148;
        even if they do not know you. In her country this is not
        common. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Karlsson can remain at CSU on
        scholarship until her degree is completed. After
        graduation, she wants to travel around the world. </strong></font></p>
