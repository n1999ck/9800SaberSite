        <td><font size="4"><strong>Pearl Jam stepped back into
        the spotlight again with their new release, &#147;Yield&#148;.
        The new album soared to number two in the top ten,
        settling in just behind the Titanic Soundtrack.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;Yield&#148; sold just over 358,000
        copies in just the first week of it&#146;s release.
        Virgin Records representative&#146;s describe sales as
        &#147;phenomenal&#148;. Rolling Stone Magazine gave the
        new album the excellent rating of four stars. <br>
        The good reviews &#147;Yield&#148; may very well be
        followed by more of the same. Sales show no sign of
        slowing, and the word about the album is spreading. This
        may be the best work that they have done as of yet.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Sales and reaction to the last
        two albums, &#147;Vitalogy&#148; and &#147;No Code&#148;,
        did not go over as well as the band had <img src="022398pearl.jpg" align="right" hspace="0" width="330" height="460"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>hoped
        they would. &#147;Yield&#148; shows us what the band was
        trying to do on the other two albums.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The album kicks off with the
        classic Pearl Jam roar on the opening track &#147;Brain
        of J&#148;, and moves into a series of songs that could
        all possibly be hit singles. The opening track is
        definitely the hardest song on the album, with most of
        the songs giving way to the newer, more mellow style the
        band has recently taken. Highlights of the album include
        &#147;Faithful&#148;, &#147;Wishlist&#148;, and &#147;In
        Hiding&#148;, which are evidence of success in the bands
        new attitude. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Pearl Jam is made up of Eddie
        Vedder, Stone Gossard, Mike McCready, and Jack Irons. The
        band recently sat down with MTV to chat about the new
        album and their new outlook on life, in general. &#147;I&#146;m
        getting older and I&#146;m tired off being pissed off. I
        don&#146;t think it&#146;s cool anymore,&#148; Vedder
        said. Gossard followed up by adding, &#147;We are getting
        older. Thirties. Not so wound up anymore. Maybe we are a
        little better at letting stuff slide.&#148; <br>
        The band does, in deed, seem to be enjoying themselves a
        little more lately. In January they once again took over
        the radio while putting together a broadcast they call
        &#147;Monkey Wrench Radio&#148;. It is basically a party
        that the band holds, inviting other bands to come and
        play with them. This years radio party may end up being
        captured in a documentary or home video collection. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Between the live music, Eddie
        Vedder plays disc jockey and spins some of his favorite
        records for everyone to hear. These records include Sonic
        Youth, Mudhoney, and Shudder To Think, all of which might
        end up opening for Pearl Jam on the upcoming tour. Eddie
        said, &#147;It&#146;s me being able to play the music I
        love and music that my friends love.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Pearl Jam&#146;s reluctance to
        tour or do videos has left fans with many questions about
        the bands future. It seems as though these questions will
        receive answers in the near future, because Pearl Jam is
        ready to step out into the public once again. In
        preparing for recording &#147;Yield&#148;, the band went
        separate ways for a short period of time before coming
        together to record. Each member brought his own demos and
        ideas with him, thus &#147;Yield&#148; was created. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Jeff Ament said, &#147;In terms
        of a creative breakthrough in music, that&#146;s the
        biggest one I&#146;ve made in years.&#148; The first
        single from the album was &#147;Given to Fly&#148;. This
        song caused a few people to take notice of the bands that
        influence Pearl Jam in their music making process. If you
        listen closely, &#147;Given to Fly&#148; is strangely
        similar to Led Zeppelin&#146;s 1971 hit &#147;Going To
        California.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Mike McCready admitted, &#147;Sure
        there&#146;s some influences that I might have stolen,
        but I just don&#146;t know.&#148; Any Led Zeppelin fans
        that take offense to this borrowing of sound should
        remember that Muddy Waters never complained about Led
        Zeppelin borrowing his sound. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The thirty-three date American
        tour for &#147;Yield&#148; kicks off in Montana on June
        20 and ends in Washington D.C. on September 18. &#147;I&#146;m
        really anxious about the music, you know, that&#146;s
        great. But we are going to Australia and Hawaii first, so
        it&#146;s kind of built around surfing,&#148; Veddersaid.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Eddie Vedder and company will
        hit Atlanta on the tour at Lakewood Amphitheater on
        September 1. Tickets for some shows are actually being
        sold through Ticketmaster. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Pearl Jam may also play on the
        David Letterman show on May 1. In another showing of the
        bands new found happiness, Eddie Vedder shared the bands
        new motto, &#147;If it ain&#146;t fun, it&#146;s funny.
        If something goes horribly wrong, we&#146;re just gonna
        have a laugh.&#148; </strong></font></p>
