        <td><font size="4"><strong>Entering the game against the
        University of North Florida, the Columbus State Lady
        Cougars had many records riding on the outcome. At stake
        was an out right conference championship, an undefeated
        conference record, a school record for victories in a
        season, and most importantly, the chance to have a huge
        momentum boost entering the upcoming PBAC tournament. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>After the opening tip the two teams
        traded baskets with UNF maintaining a slight lead. While
        the Lady Ospreys moved the ball through CSU&#146;s
        suffocating full court press, the rumblings of &#147;Could
        this be the let down game for the Lady Cougars&#148;
        began to circulate through Woodruff Gym. Columbus soon
        put those thoughts to rest as a 9-0 run at the 11:47 mark
        began the Lady Cougar route. A Reagan Housch
        three-pointer put CSU up by 10 and the full court press
        began to take effect as UNF was forced into 15 first half
        turnovers. Poor defense killed any chance of a UNF first
        half comeback. The Lady Ospreys committed 14 personal
        fouls, the majority of those coming in the waning minutes
        of the first half and CSU responded by connecting on 70%
        of their free-throws. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The second half opened with the
        Lady Ospreys looking like a completely different team.
        After being down by 16 at the half, UNF opened with five
        unanswered points. CSU began to look sloppy as turnovers
        and poor rebounding kept UNF close. What started as a
        Columbus blowout soon became a tense nail-biter as an
        11-2 run pulled the Lady Ospreys to within six points
        with only 5:52 left in the game. &#147;We were taking
        good shots, maybe a little too quick, (the shots) just
        weren&#146;t dropping for us,&#148; stated head coach Jay
        Sparks. The Lady Cougars needed a hero and they got it
        from an unlikely source. With the fans and players on the
        edge of their seats, senior point guard Holly Pearson
        took a pass and drained her only basket of the game, a
        key three-pointer from the left corner. The Pearson bomb
        started a crucial 10-0 run, capped by a three-point play
        by Que Gilliam. The Lady Cougars never looked back as
        they pulled away to take an 88-68 victory. Tocshia
        Campfield led all scorers with 21 points and Sylvia Allen
        pulled down a game high eight rebounds</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The victory over North Florida
        finished a perfect conference season at 16-0. When asked
        how he felt about the victory and the undefeated season,
        Sparks simply replied, &#147;Outstanding, It&#146;s the
        greatest feeling ever.&#148; Reagan Housch, who finished
        the game with five three-pointers stated, &#147;At the
        first practice we knew we could go all the way.&#148; The
        next challenge for the 22-4 Lady Cougars is the Peach
        Belt Conference tournament in Savannah, GA which runs
        from February 20th through the 25th.</strong></font></p>
