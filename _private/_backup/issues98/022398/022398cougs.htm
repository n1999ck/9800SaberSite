        <td><font size="4"><strong>Larry Coates poured in a game
        high 23 points including five three pointers as the CSU
        Cougars downed the North Florida Ospreys 85-77.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Coates began the game with a bang as he
        connected from three-point range to start the scoring.
        The first half stayed at a fast tempo as both teams
        consistently pushed the ball up the court quickly. The
        Cougars were clinging to a slim six point lead late in
        the half when a key 7-3 run put Columbus up by 10. The
        run was capped off by a thunderous one-handed dunk from
        Jermaine Taylor.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>UNF came out in the second half
        and a flurry of baskets put the Ospreys down by only two
        43-41. After a quick five point run by the Cougars, North
        Florida went on a huge 11-4 run of their own and tied the
        game at 52 a piece, much to the displeasure of head coach
        Herbert Greene. &#147;We just didn&#146;t combat their
        aggressive play very well at all,&#148; stated Greene. A
        Coates three-pointer began the decisive rally as the
        Cougars responded to the Osprey run and went on a 25-8
        outburst. &#147;Larry (Coates) really made them
        (three-pointers) at big points in the game.&#148; replied
        assistant coach Robert Moore, &#147;He definitely knows
        when to hit them.&#148; Columbus opened up a 10-point
        lead late in the game and stretched it to as many as
        seventeen as the Cougars cruised to a fifteen point
        victory.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>With the victory, Columbus
        State clinched the PBAC South Division Championship and
        will be seeded 1st in the upcoming PBAC tournament. Also
        in the victory one record was broken and another tied.
        The victory over UNF gave CSU victory number 23 of the
        season, breaking the mark of 22 which was achieved
        several times throughout the Cougar&#146;s history.
        Coates tied a thirteen year old record by handing out 242
        assist this season. When asked how he felt about the
        record, Coates replied, &#147;I&#146;m happy about tying
        the record but I really wanted to break it.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The Cougars now travel to
        Savannah, GA for the Peach Belt tournament which begins
        February 20th and finishes on the 25th.</strong></font></p>
