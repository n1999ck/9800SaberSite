        <td><font size="4"><strong>In the Feb. 2 issue, the Saber
        editor implies that a woman with a college degree will
        earn 75% of what a man with the same qualifications and
        experience would. This is a fallacy. If at one time the
        female population of the U.S. as a whole earned 75% of
        what the male population did, it was because fewer women
        had completed their post-secondary education and many
        would eventually sacrifice their careers to raise a
        family. Today, women constitute the majority of college
        graduates and are free to choose their own destiny. It
        has become socially acceptable to remain childless or
        develop some kind of alternative child-rearing
        arrangement if natalist urges must be fulfilled. Think
        about it - what company would risk pissing off half the
        consumers of the U.S. by overtly discriminating against
        women? But go ahead and keep believing the &#147;75%&#148;
        statistic and you&#146;ll contribute further to the very
        divisiveness the editorial laments about. Go ahead and
        choose to be a victim.</strong></font><p align="left"><font size="4"><strong>- Modern Man</strong></font></p>
