        Campus of Columbus State University. These organizations
        are, overall, the best of college life. These
        organizations allow students to get involved on campus
        and to have fun and actually learn something about the
        other students on campus. These organizations give
        students something to do other than just come to class
        and go home.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Student
        activities are also something else that allow students to
        be active. If a student is not a part of an organization,
        the campus organizations sponsor other events that are,
        best of all, free to all students. For example, there are
        concerts, fraternity and sorority parties during rush
        week, game shows in the cafe&#146;, and coed sports in
        the evenings.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Students either don&#146;t know
        about these events because of poor advertising or just
        don&#146;t come because they are too lazy or their
        friends don&#146;t come. I can understand not coming
        because of poor advertising, that&#146;s the fault of the
        supporter, but not coming because your friends don&#146;t
        want to or because you just don&#146;t feel like it is
        the worst reason in the world. As students, you should
        want to go out into the world and try something new.
        Being lazy never got anyone anywhere, never discovered
        something new, or never passed a class. And your friends,
        if they jumped off a bridge, would you follow, of course
        you would, but only if it was a very low to the ground
        bridge. Your friend shouldn&#146;t have control over what
        you do unless your drunk and you need a ride home.<br>
        I would like to see more students at event here on
        campus. If you want to express your feelings about
        events, go by the office you think sponsored the event
        and tell.them how you feel. If you want to get more
        involved, do the same thing. All 70 of the organizations
        on campus want more attendance in their meetings and also
        at their event. You becoming involved as a student looks
        good on a resume and also helps you to meet new people
        and new connections for later in life.</strong></font></p>
