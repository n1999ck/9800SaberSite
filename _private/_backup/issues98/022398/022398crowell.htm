        <td><font size="4"><strong>When he was a little boy,
        William J. Crowell was not quite sure what his future
        would bring. He was diagnosed with post-polio syndrome in
        1946 and a big part of his childhood was spent in and out
        of hospitals and fighting the disease.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>This year, 52 years later, Crowell,
        faculty member of the Communication Department,
        celebrates his 31st anniversary at CSU. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Lyndon Johnson was President of
        the U.S. and Dr. Thomas Y. Whitley was President of
        Columbus College. The Communications Department as we
        know it today did not exist. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;A lot has happened since
        I first came here on June 10th, 1967,&#148; he says. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Professor Crowell went to work
        for the Department of Theater and Liberal Arts. Soon the
        Communications Department was born and he became the
        first faculty member. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Crowell taught one course for
        15 months, a course called &#147;Basic Speaking.&#148;
        This course is well known today among students as COM
        105, Public Speaking. Gradually, he added on more courses
        such as Group Discussion, Persuasive Speaking and
        Interpersonal Communications. He moved the Department
        forward and in the early 70&#146;s communication studies
        were offered as a minor first, and in the later 70&#146;s
        also as a major. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;I love to teach&#148;, he
        says. &#147;It&#146;s always been what I like to do best.&#148;
        Crowell&#146;s enthusiasm and dedication shows. To this
        day he has accumulated 280 hours of sick leave.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>A former student of Crowell&#146;s,
        Wanda Newsom, remembers, &#147;When I took Professor
        Crowell&#146;s Interpersonal Communication Course in the
        fall of 1981, I really enjoyed him as a teacher. It
        seemed like he really enjoyed teaching us, and that, in
        turn, made me enjoy taking his class. I received a
        certificate for being &#147;the best improved
        communicator&#148; and I was very proud of that. I always
        felt like I could not communicate well, however, with his
        encouragement everything seemed possible.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Crowell&#146;s determination to
        push the development of the Communication Department
        forward was evident when he applied for a grant to
        establish a speech lab for the Communications Department
        at CSU. His brainchild became reality when the grant was
        approved, the equipment was ordered, and room 005 in the
        basement of Schwob Library was made available to set the
        lab up. &#147;We put a lot of work and effort into the
        development of this lab,&#148; he says. &#147;Today this
        speech lab has earned the reputation for being the best
        in the region. People come to us to get advice on setting
        up their labs.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Crowell holds an undergraduate
        degree in history and speech from Bowling Green State
        University, Ohio. He earned his masters degree in speech
        and theater at the State University in St. Cloud,
        Minnesota. He also took 25 courses toward his doctorate
        at Louisiana State University and 22 more courses at
        Auburn University. Crowell then switched to Georgia State
        University to write his dissertation. However, because of
        political problems and the closure of the Georgia State
        University Communications Department Professor Crowell
        never completed his dissertation and therefore never
        receive his doctorate.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>When asked how he felt about
        his historical impact here at CSU he told us, &#147;I
        feel like I have three histories here at CSU: The first
        ten years I developed the Columbus College Choral
        Readers, a body of students who would travel all through
        the Southeast reading aloud to various audiences. My
        second ten years I was involved with the direction of
        television and news production. For the last ten years I
        have devoted my time to writing and revising my book and
        developing speech labs.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Crowell&#146;s book, &#147;Successful
        Public Speaking&#148; has been published four times and
        is used here at CSU for COM 105. He is currently working
        on the fifth edition - his last one, he says. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;Been there, done that,
        moving on.&#148; he comments, &#147;I look forward to
        retirement in 1999. It will give me the opportunity to
        travel the U.S. with my wife in a recreational vehicle,
        buy some more land and horses, and do all those things. I
        also enjoy doing, but never had a lot of time for.&#148; </strong></font></p>
