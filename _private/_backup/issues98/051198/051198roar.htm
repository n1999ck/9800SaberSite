    University. Until yesterday, I was proud to tell anyone who asked that I am a student
    here. My eyes were opened while watching The Dating Game in the Davidson Cafeteria on
    Wednesday, April 29, 1998.</font></strong></p>
    <font size="4"><p><strong>The event was sponsored by the Student Programming Counsel - a
    committee that is responsible for providing games and entertainment for the students. I
    admit that their goal was accomplished. The fault was that of the students in the
    cafeteria that day.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>In the first game, because the bachelorettes took too long in answering any of
    the bachelor's questions, he just got up and walked off of the stage! How babyish! But,
    SPC pulled through and found another bachelor to take his place. The &quot;ladies&quot;
    that were on that panel also had much to be desired - that is, as far as maturity goes! To
    these &quot;ladies,&quot; the name of the game was The Dating Game ... NOT the Bashing
    Game!</strong></p>
    <p><strong>On to game two...</strong></p>
    <p><strong>I felt sooooo sorry for the bachelorette that volunteered for this game! Just
    the fact that the audience was rooting against her was bad enough. The bachelors were
    crude and obnoxious! All I have to say to them is GROW UP! Just because the news media
    showed up, these &quot;men&quot; started to show off. It was some of the worse taste ever
    shown on this campus! I have heard several students around campus in the past ask why the
    news stations in Columbus covers more about what Auburn University does than what Columbus
    State University does. Think about it people, this is why!</strong></p>
    <p><strong>I would not be surprised if I never saw The Dating Game on this campus again.
    If behavior like what I saw yesterday ever happens again, I would not be surprised if
    there are not as many events on this campus within the next year! This committee, I'm
    sure, is going to get a large amount of complaints from the faculty and staff that were
    trying to enjoy their weekly buffet in the next room. Complaints about something that got
    so out of their control and out of hand.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>To the Student Programming Counsel, thank you for all that you do. To the news
    media that showed up, thank you for not embarrassing us publicly. And, finally, to the
    student body that was present in the audience and those who participated, I only have this
    to say: I know that this is the first time you have been out of your mommy and daddy's
    control. It's time to grow up!</strong></p>
