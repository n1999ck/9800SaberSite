        <td><font size="4"><strong>When the reality of being a
        non-traditional age student really hits a person,
        everything becomes so frantic and important in life. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Having already wasted so many years and
        then finally returning to school with people much younger
        than myself I was at first very intimidated. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>It&#146;s also enough to make
        the most boisterous person clam up, therefore becoming
        what is called a &#147;Phantom Student.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Patricia Nelson Limerick, a
        famous frontier historian, wrote a very informative essay
        called, &#147;The Phenomenon of Phantom Students,&#148;
        that was published in a weekly publication for the
        university community at Harvard. In this essay she
        defines a Phantom Student as, &#147;The radically
        disengaged, those staying resolutely on the academic
        periphery, taking large lecture classes and writing
        survivalist papers and exams.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I consider myself a phantom
        student but the difference between the student&#146;s
        Limerick speaks of and myself is the fact that I am an
        older student, what Columbus State University deems
        necessary to call an Adult Reentry Student. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Returning to college brought
        joy and excitement into my life and a sense of purpose. I
        couldn&#146;t wait to get into class and meet new people
        and my professors. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I thought very naively that
        college would be different from high school, I just know
        some of my professors would surely be close to my age and
        talking to them would be a discussion, not just they talk
        and me listen, I was wrong. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>My first quarter, on the first
        day of class, the first words I heard were: &#147;I
        don&#146;t give a damn if you come to class or not as
        long as you are here on test day. Whether you pass or
        fail is no concern of mine. My paycheck will still be the
        same.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I couldn&#146;t believe what I
        was hearing. I have no doubt that after hearing what this
        professor had to say, I had subconsciously committed
        myself to phantom-hood. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I wanted to be treated
        differently because I was an older student, I guess I got
        just what I asked for. I don&#146;t know what the ratio
        of older to younger is at Columbus State University, but
        from my view it looks like 5000 to 1. In my classes the
        older generation takes a back seat.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Not only do we take a back seat
        in number but in attention also. During my adult reentry
        classes I took to refresh me on college life, I was led
        to believe that the professors paid special attention to
        adult students whenever possible, but I learned this is
        not so. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>It seems as though the
        professors focus more on the younger students. I came to
        that conclusion in my first quarter </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>also, my music appreciation
        class. The professor would use examples, in order to give
        better understanding to his students, which would apply
        to younger students. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>For example, he would try to
        show the difference in the way that Mozart dressed so
        formally, compared to &#147;grunge, as you kids wear
        these days.&#148; I didn&#146;t know what grunge was. I
        had to ask the young person seated next to me, who just
        looked at me like I had no sense of fashion. So, in the
        second class of the day phantom-hood prevailed again
        because I realized that this professor was speaking to
        the younger students and my first professor doesn&#146;t
        give a damn.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Speaking with a fellow adult
        student about being a phantom student, he said,
        &#147;Maybe we made our selves phantoms.,&#148; I was
        dumbstruck. When reading Limerick&#146;s theories on
        phantoms, I had a one-track mind because of past
        experience. I never added myself into the reasoning but
        the proof was there in my friend&#146;s words as plain as
        day: I had done this to myself I should have been more
        objective instead of being quiet, never asking questions,
        and being intimidated by the younger students and my
        professors. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Then after carefully analyzing
        every aspect of why I had fell into phantom-hood, I
        realized that I had help becoming this person that was
        seen and not heard.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>All of the blame does not lie
        with me. My professors aided me in becoming invisible.
        For example, in one of my classes this quarter there are
        two younger students. They both always have something to
        say, one of them generally has good feedback and everyone
        seems to understand her. The other also gives a lot of
        feedback but no one understands him. Only the professor
        seems to grasp exactly what he means. Everyone else just
        sits with the look of, &#147;What did he just say?&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>To these two the professor
        always states, &#147;Oh, that&#146;s so interesting&#148;
        or &#147;Oh, that&#146;s so deep.&#148; If I comment, she
        looks at me like she is dumfounded and just says,
        &#147;Oh ... Okay.&#148; This brings to mind a passage of
        Limerick&#146;s essay where she states a number of myths
        that include, &#147;Professors only want to talk with
        other elegant, learned and brilliant
        conversationalists.&#148; I don&#146;t consider myself a
        brilliant conversationalist, but by the same token
        neither am I inarticulate. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Even though this professor is a
        favorite of mine she makes me question my intelligence at
        least fifty times before the end of class. It would have
        been better if she would just make up something to say to
        me instead of, unbeknownst to her, embarrassing me. There
        have been occasions where I&#146;ve just remained silent
        for the rest of class for fear of being labeled an old
        fool. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>I&#146;ve realized that there
        are professors who really care about my academic progress
        and there are those who don&#146;t. I&#146;ve learned to
        feed off of the ones who are stimulating my mind the most
        and take what they&#146;ve told me and use to my
        advantage in other courses.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Ultimately, what stays with me
        from Limerick&#146;s essay is when she states
        ,Professors, like most other individuals, like
        snowflakes, are all different. That surely is a part of
        their charm.&#148; I know now that it&#146;s not up to my
        professor to baby sit me and tell me everything in detail
        just because I am an older student, nor is it up to them
        to bring me out of phantom-hood. I believe that just as
        life is what one makes it so is one&#146;s education. I
        have four years left before I graduate, from Columbus
        State College and I intend to make professors see how
        they can hurt or help someone&#146;s education,
        especially the older student. Professors need to realize
        that they have students from all age ranges in their
        classes not just eighteen and nineteen year-olds. Maybe
        if I could somehow make them think back to when they were
        in college and remember the commitment they made to
        themselves that made them want to be teachers. I really
        don&#146;t think professors wanted a degree in teaching
        to alienate students. </strong></font></p>
