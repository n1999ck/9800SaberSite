    <td><font size="4"><strong>The Confederates are attacking again sir and we must retreat.
    General sir, the rebels are upon us and we must retreat back to Chattanooga.</strong><p><strong>Those
    similar sounds and lasting images still reverberated across the countryside April 17-18
    when the CSU ROTC Battalion visited Chickamauga Battlefield in Fort Oglethorpe, Ga.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The &quot;staff ride&quot; culminated a three month study of military history
    into one of the bloodiest battles fought during the Civil War - The Battle of Chickamauga.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Cadets were placed in four study groups at the beginning of the winter quarter
    and began their extensive researching of assigned strategic areas of the 19-20 September
    1863 battle.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>&quot;The cadets did a super job of researching their specific areas,&quot;
    said Lt. Col. Steven M. Carmichael, Professor of Military Science. &quot;They were able to
    apply what they had learned in the books and graphically portray the battlefield for all
    to learn from,&quot; he added.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The cadets used poster boards, flash cards and some of the 1,400 monuments and
    historical markers to denote Union and Confederate positions and movements. Many of the
    cadets also brought out personalities of the various combatants and leadership to better
    understand what happened on these &quot;hallowed grounds.&quot;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Although a drizzling rain attempted to put a damper on the outdoor activities,
    the cadets remained excited and thoroughly interested at each of the sites.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>&quot;Overall, the staff ride was very informative,&quot; said Raymond Herras,
    a sophomore cadet. &quot;By studying what happened at Chickamauga, we understand what to
    do and not to do in battle,&quot; he added. Herras also added that he was looking forward
    to next year's staff study and trip to Kennesaw Battlefield.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Although this year's staff ride was a complete success, the Military Science
    department is busy preparing next year's event.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The Staff Ride, ROTC 4405, will be offered as part of the Military Science
    curriculum during Spring Semester 1999. If you would like to visit and study another great
    Civil War battlefield near Kennesaw Mountain, Ga., then sign up and learn more about
    America's notable and interesting history.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Who knows what sounds will be heard next year?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>General, we must retreeeeeeeeeeeeeat .................</strong></font></td>
