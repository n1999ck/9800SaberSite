        five weeks into the Spring Quarter and Greek Council
        wasted no time in it&#146;s pursuit of excitement on
        campus. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Last
        week nine different greek organizations participated in
        what proved to be a competitive, yet successful Greek
        Week. The greek system at Columbus State has grown a
        little since last year&#146;s greek week which introduced
        a few new faces to the scene this year.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>In the past, the greek system
        at Columbus State University has consisted of eight
        organizations, with everyone of them bringing their own
        aspects to the campus. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>With the addition of a new
        sorority on campus, Phi Mu Kappa, the greek system is
        making an effort to increase it&#146;s status at Columbus
        State University. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Greek Week &#145;98 allowed the
        members of every greek organization to have fun, and at
        the same time, learn a little about themselves and other
        organizations as well. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>There were six greek
        organizations actively involved in this year&#146;s Greek
        Week. These organizations participated extensively by
        sponsoring specific events on certain days throughout the
        week. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Greek Week &#145;98 began on
        Sunday, April 19 and finished up on Saturday, April 25.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Every member of a greek
        organization was able to participate in events and become
        actively involved in the Columbus community as well. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Some of the events that were
        presented during Greek Week this year were a scavenger
        hunt, greek olympics, basketball tournament, mud
        volleyball, tug of war and a danceathon. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Other events included a
        parent&#146;s picnic, 30th Avenue School tutoring,
        cafeteria day and CSU day at the Red Stixx Game. </strong></font></p>
