    <td><font size="4"><strong>Let me start off by telling everyone to go see this movie. </strong><p><strong>City
    Of Angels is a treat to watch, and I highly recommend it. The movie, loosely based on Wim
    Wender's film Wings Of Desire, stars Nicolas Cage, Meg Ryan, Dennis Franz, and Andre
    Braugher. </strong></p>
    <p><img src="city_of_angels.jpg" alt="city of angels.jpg (8294 bytes)" align="left" WIDTH="305" HEIGHT="181"><strong>The
    story goes as follows: There are angels looking over the city of Los Angeles, and
    everywhere else, I guess, but the movie is set in Los Angeles. The angels can read the
    minds of humans, and can only be seen by the very young, the dying, or if they want you to
    see them. Their job is to deliver you from life into Heaven when you die. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Seth, played by Nicolas Cage, is one of these angels. Seth hangs out with a
    fellow angel ,Cassiel, played by Andre Braugher. They spend the day and eventually begin
    to wonder what it is like to be human. You see, the angels have no sense of smell, taste,
    or touch, but they are immortal. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Seth realizes that he can make the choice to become human, but cannot find a
    reason to make such a decision. Then Maggie comes into his life. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Maggie, played by Meg Ryan, is a doctor who at this time has just lost a
    patient and is extremely upset by this. Seth decides to let Maggie see him, and the rest I
    cannot tell you because it would ruin the movie for you. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Dennis Franz, of NYPD Blue, and Andre Braugher, of Homicide, are given
    relatively small roles in the movie, but they play their parts perfectly. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Cage and Ryan deliver great performances and are extremely believable in their
    roles. Nicolas Cage actually comes across as an angel in the film, and Meg Ryan portrays
    the skeptical surgeon very well. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Brad Silberling, director of the children's movie Casper, directed this movie
    and proved that he is very capable of handling a love story. This is a good movie, and
    once again, I recommend seeing it. </strong></font></td>
