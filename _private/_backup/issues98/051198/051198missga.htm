        contestants that will compete in the Miss Georgia Pageant
        and is currently attending CSU. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Brinson is originally from Bainbridge, GA and
        has been attending CSU for two years. She is a sophomore
        with a grade point average of 3.23. She is majoring in
        Choral Music Education and plans to attend Florida State
        University to receive a Ph.D. in Choral Conducting in the
        future.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Brinson won Miss Greater Southwest Georgia in
        order to compete in the Miss Georgia Pageant. This was
        her first win in the Miss Georgia Preliminary Contest. </strong></p>

        since she was fifteen years old. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Although she was awarded $600 for her most
        recent win, it was not her biggest. In 1996, Brinson won
        Miss Georgia Forestry and was awarded $2,500.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Brinson has had the advantage of preparing for
        the pageant since July. She says a lot of work goes into
        preparing for the competition like working out at the gym
        for 2 to 2 1/2 hours a day, finding a choreographer for
        the talent, and choosing the best outfits. She also has
        to find time to manage 20 quarter hours as well as
        teaching 2nd graders math and music.</strong></p>

        rather unique compared to what most contestants
        emphasize. Her title is &quot;Music for Sound
        Education.&quot; She wants to help people learn through
        music. Brinson's platform is based on the idea that
        certain types of music enhance learning. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Brinson also enjoys many hobbies when she has
        time. She enjoys fishing, jogging, and many water sports.
        She is also a Star Trek fan.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Shana Teel is another contestant in the race
        for Miss Georgia. She is working on her Masters Degree at
        CSU. She won Miss Presidential Pathways as her
        preliminary pageant to advance to the Miss Georgia
        Pageant and was awarded $1250.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Teel is a Florida native. She earned her
        Bachelor's Degree from a university in Tennessee and
        graduated with honors. While residing in Tennessee, Teel
        placed eighth in the Miss Tennessee Pageant.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Since moving to the Columbus area, Teel has
        been involved on campus. At one point she worked with the
        Greek organizations and now she works with the Counseling
        Center to help those with eating disorders.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Teel's platform deals with eating disorders.
        In her teen years she suffered from an eating disorder
        and weighed only 67 pounds. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>According for Charles Eason, Director Planned
        Giving for University Advancement, &quot;You couldn't
        even recognize her. If they hadn't put her in the
        hospital when they did, she would have died in three
        days.&quot; </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Now Teel is busy trying to prevent this from
        happening to others. She recently spoke to the females at
        Hardaway High School about preventing eating disorders.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The third contestant from CSU is Amy Swanson.
        She is the current Miss Columbus and she received a
        scholarship for her prize. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Swanson has an Associate Degree in Journalism
        and is a Communications Major with a concentration in
        Public Relations. Swanson is the host of News Briefs on
        Fox 54. Swanson competed in the Columbus Pageant with a
        cracked bone in her foot. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>In an interview with the Saber shortly after
        winning the Miss Columbus title Swanson said, &quot;I had
        to compete with a cracked bone in my foot. Usually I
        exercise more just before a competition, but since I just
        got a cast off the day before I couldn't prepare much as
        far as that goes.&quot;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A former Miss Presidential Pathways, Swanson
        has also won Miss Tifton in the past. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Along with other community work Swanson works
        to help raise awareness and support for the Special
        Olympics.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Miss Georgia Competition is a week long
        event and the winner goes on to compete in the Miss
        America pageant.</strong></font></p>
