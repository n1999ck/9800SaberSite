    Computer Science Department. He is currently completing his Masters in Computer Science
    and works as a software development Consultant at CSU. There he develops online courseware
    software, specifically for the CSU Online initiative, with Dr. Jim Leonard. He also
    provides software and networking solutions for several professors on campus.</strong><p><strong>Robert
    specializes in Windows NT software development, the Internet, web application development,
    Windows NT and Internet server networking. He also writes technical books about Windows NT
    and Microsoft Certification for Macmillan Publishing and recently for a foreign publisher
    in Singapore. He has earned the Competitive Edge 4-Year Science Scholarship, the Callaway
    SAT Scholarship, the Governor's Scholarship for STAR Students and the HOPE Scholarship. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Organizational Communications (COMM445) is lucky enough to have Robert as its
    Chief Information Officer. &quot;I'm developing and testing a web-based application with
    components that enable students to view live or stored audio/video lectures and view slide
    shows,&quot; Robert explained. &quot;Students can learn and interact with the class, view
    the same material and hear the same lectures as their in-class classmates.&quot; This is
    known as remote learning.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>When asked how he became interested in computers, Robert thinks his sister got
    him hooked. &quot;I decided that Ôcomputer geek' sounded a little better than just
    Ôgeek',&quot; he said. He likes playing blues guitar and target shooting. &quot;I just
    bought a new ESP electric guitar and a Remington 700 rifle and I'm not sure which one is
    more dangerous.&quot; He enjoys listening to the Doors and says he spends too much money
    on Star Wars toys because he never had them as a kid.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Robert's goals are to own a Jaguar XK8 by November and be a millionaire by age
    25. He'd like to improve his shooting aim, travel the world, and publish something besides
    computer books. &quot;I just bought a new ESP electric guitar and a Remington 700 rifle
    and I'm not sure which one is more dangerous.&quot; He enjoys listening to the Doors and
    says he spends too much money on Star Wars toys because he never had them as a kid.</strong></font></td>
