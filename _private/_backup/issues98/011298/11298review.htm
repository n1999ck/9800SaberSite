<br>
The 18th film in Ean Flemming&#146;s James Bond series had no
problem delivering non stop action with yet another way 007
manages to save the world from the brink of destruction. For
those that have followed the James Bond series, there seems to
always be a global threat ignited by a main evil doer who makes
it a point to find time to do Bond in. In &#147;Tomorrow Never
Dies,&#148; the overall plot stays true to form but is refreshed
by teaming Bond up with a sexy Chinese agent who adds martial
arts to the films arsenal of explosions and gunplay. <br>

<p><font size="4">Coming off a successful debut in &#147;Golden
Eye,&#148; Brosnan has no problem playing a cool debonair bond
reminiscent to that of Sean Connery. With the addition of
Michelle Yeoh who also starred in the Jackie Chan movie
&#147;Super Cop&#148;, &#147;Tomorrow Never Dies&#148; never hits
a lull and has no problem selling its plot, which makes
&#147;Tomorrow Never Dies&#148; one to watch. <strong>Three
Stars.</strong><br>

The characters and plot are what made this a good movie. Based on
the 1995 novel Rum Punch by Elmore Leonard. &#147; Jackie
Brown&#148; reminded you of &#147;Pulp Fiction&#148; in a lot of
ways Quentin Tarrintino writes the plot and dialogue among the
characters in his movies. The story although taken out of
adaptation of a novel never gives you a clue of what happens
next. Like many of Tarantino&#146;s other films, &#147;Resevoir
Dogs&#148;, &#147;True Romance&#148; &amp; &#147;Pulp
Fiction&#148;, the characters are all unique and has the story
just following what they might normally do in a day. Samuel L.
Jackson has the best character as gun-runner &#147;Ordell
Robi&#148; who plays a role somewhat like that of the hitman in
&#147;Pulp Fiction&#148;. &#147;Jackie Brown&#148; was a welcomed
relief from &#147;Four Rooms&#148; and &#147;Dusk till Dawn&#148;
and shows that former video rental clerk, Tarrintino, has made a
movie befitting his talent. <strong>Three Stars. </strong><br>

I know everyone says they loved it and it was the best movie this
year or they would see it again but this was the longest movie I
have ever seen in one day. Three hours and forty five minutes, if
you include previews, of romance was hard to handle. I will give
Leonardo credit for some descent acting, but his co-star was not
that bright and there was a obvious difference in talent between
the two. The story was historically accurate but the dialogue and
plot were very average, and even sometimes boring. I don&#146;t
want to seem morbid but my favorite part of the movie is when the
boat finally sank. There were some very realistic stunts
especially when that guy fell off the back and hit the propeller
which kind of made me wake up for a few minutes. Guys if you plan
to take a date to this movie bring a thermos of coffee and maybe
a tent. This is not to say I have anything against romance or
anything like that, I think &#147;Braveheart&#148; is a great
romance and would gladly watch it twice in a row before seeing
this again. &#147;Titanic&#148; gets <strong>Four Torpedoes</strong>
