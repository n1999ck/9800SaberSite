        <td><font size="4">What is &#147;Toxic Media&#148;? Do
        you think you&#146;re exposed to it? Is it harmful? The
        Unitarian Universalists (U.U.) are hosting a series
        during the month of March pertaining to the infiltration
        of media into our lives. WORLD magazine will the source
        of the information discussed with U.U. members in a one
        session lecture provided by CSU Psychology/Sociology
        professor, Dr. Cecile Doroff.</font><p><font size="4">The
        U.U. has no nation wide formal creed or test of
        membership for members. According to several websites
        from fellowships across the country, parishioners are not
        required to submit to any particular set of beliefs.
        Instead, it is a place for anyone regardless of specific
        spiritual beliefs.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The series &#147;Toxic Media&#148;
        refers to the ever-present leakage of the media into our
        lives via television, newspapers, magazines, electronic
        media, radio, and other sources. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The series will also include
        information about the harm found in the way media targets
        people, particularly the young. Small children want
        televisions in their rooms and Sony PlayStations.
        According to material to be presented in the series,
        teens are the hardest hit by feeling they have to have
        Tommy Hilfiger clothing and Nikes to be accepted. Adults
        want bigger houses and $40,000 cars. People believe they
        have to get second jobs in order to buy these things. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">March 1 is the first in the series,
        which will be an open forum, led by member Chris
        Lancaster. Toxic Media and how to regain control over our
        lives is the topic for this discussion.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">March 15 is a lecture led by Dr. Doroff
        entitled &#147;Woman and the Media; Our Sexual
        Contradictions of Womanhood&#148;. Doroff will discuss
        the &#147;commonalties of several stereotypes accepted by
        both men and women&#148;. She stated that many women are
        victims to anorexia due to the pressure to look like
        &#147;the ideal woman.&#148; The lecture will include
        such examples as the new expanded Barbie with the wider
        hips and smaller bust. Will society still want to
        purchase the doll?</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">March 22 will be the discussion of
        &#147;The Beauty Myth and Self-Esteem&#148;, led by
        member Jennifer Harriman. This will focus on how the
        media-influenced ideas of beauty, success and power
        relate to our self-esteem. Also discussed will be the
        truisms and what is financially acquired in order to feel
        self worth and success.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">All meetings will be at 10:30 a.m. at
        the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Columbus located
        at 1442 Double Churches Road, Columbus.</font></p>
