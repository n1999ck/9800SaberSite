        <td><font size="4">The Orientation Team at CSU is a group
        of students who are trained to help people who are new to
        the campus.</font><p><font size="4">Orientation leaders
        are available to help people find their way around campus
        and to answer questions regarding general academic
        information. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><img src="020998oteam.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="290" height="196"></font><font size="4">Team leaders also give
        guided tours of the campus and explain to students how to
        drop and add classes, acquire degree progress sheets,
        catalogs and directories. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Grant Salter, a CSU student and
        Orientation leader, says, &#147;I think it gives you a
        great chance to give back to the school. It makes a
        positive image for the institution.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Lisa Rios has been a Orientation leader
        since last spring. She says, &#147;I had the chance to
        apply to be an Orientation leader. I had to submit an
        application and find references for myself. I then had to
        meet with the advisor, Cecilia Buffkin, the orientation
        graduate assistant, and a small group of other
        applicants. After the whole process was finished, I was
        selected for the 97-98 team. I spent the summer bonding
        with my fellow leaders, working on public speaking
        techniques, familiarizing myself with the campus, and
        learning to deal with large numbers of people.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Each year the Orientation Team goes
        through a series of training sessions and then goes on a
        retreat. Last years retreat was held in the General
        Coffee State Park in South Georgia. This year&#146;s
        retreat will most likely be held in North Georgia.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Rios also says that even though it was
        a lot of work, especially since she works full time in
        addition to attending classes, she saw the experience as
        a wonderful opportunity to contribute to the CSU
        community. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">&#147;Being a member of the &#147;O&#148;
        team is rewarding in several ways. First, I get to know
        about my school in depth. I probably would not have taken
        the time if I had not joined the Orientation Team. I know
        things like, what the first four original buildings on
        campus are, what&#146;s under the clock tower, and where
        the &#147;boom room&#148; is located. Second, I get a
        chance to meet new people at the orientations,&#148; Rios
        says.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">According to Rios, Orientation leaders
        aim for making a good, lasting impression. She says it&#146;s
        a wonderful feeling to have a new student call out your
        name as you pass on campus. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Bobby Ferrone is another Orientation
        leader with good things to say about the program. He
        says, &#147;It is a great opportunity to develop
        leadership skills and be able to present myself in front
        of a large body of people.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Those interested in the Orientation
        team should contact Cecilia Buffkin in the Student
        Development office in the Davidson Center, room 271.</font></p>
