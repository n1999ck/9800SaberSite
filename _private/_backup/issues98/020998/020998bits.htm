        <td><font size="4">Marilyn Manson is set to release his
        new autobiography this month. Manson titled his new
        venture &#147;The Long Hard Road Out of Hell.&#148; One
        can only guess as to what mysteries will be contained in
        this new project of Marilyn Manson&#146;s. The release of
        the book will be kicked off by a book signing at midnight
        on Valentine&#146;s Day at Tower Books in New York City.
        The book signing tour will last several weeks, and span
        across the nation. Marilyn Manson will also be performing
        on MTV Live on, appropriately, the upcoming Friday the
        thirteenth. </font><p><font size="4">Steven Adler is also
        dropping the instruments and picking up a pen for the
        next several months. The former Guns&#146;N&#146;Roses
        drummer has written a book and is currently looking for
        the best publishing deal before he signs to have it
        printed. &#147;No Bed of Roses&#148; documents
        Adler&#146;s experiences before, during, and after his
        stint with Guns&#146;N&#146;Roses. Adler was publicly
        fired from the band by frontmen Axl Rose and Slash at the
        1990 MTV Video Music Awards. The band sited Adler&#146;s
        drug abuse as the reason for the firing. Adler admits
        that his seven year addiction to heroin and cocaine
        ruined his relationship with the band. He also admits
        that all his money, including the $2.3 million he
        received for being fired from Guns&#146;N&#146;Roses, was
        dwindled away by drug abuse. Deanne Adler, Steven&#146;s
        mother, also tells her side of the story in the book. The
        story documents thirty-one trips to the emergency room,
        one heart attack, and one stroke, all due to drug abuse.
        Along with the book, Adler says he has a new song to
        accompany it , and is in negotiations with several
        organizations about either signing or creating his own
        music label. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The British anarchist group,
        Chumbawamba, are out to prove that they are not just
        another one hit wonder. Nevermind the fact that it took
        the band fifteen years to obtain their first hit single,
        they seem to think they can do it again with their next
        single. The upcoming release for Chumbawamba is called
        &#147;Amnesia.&#148; The band issued a statement about
        the new song, &#147;People forget what Bill Clinton says
        before he gets elected is not what Bill Clinton will do
        when he is in office. The song is not about Bill Clinton,
        but all politicians.&#148; The bands distrust of politics
        and dislike for authority has become very well known
        lately. Last week the band issued a statement to fans
        urging them to obtain their album any way possible,
        including stealing it. That is probably not the best
        marketing technique available, but when hit singles come
        once every fifteen years, they are probably just happy
        that somebody is still listening. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Former Judas Priest frontman Rob
        Halford has signed a new deal with Nothing Records.
        Nothing Records is owned by Nine Inch Nails mastermind
        Trent Reznor. Reznor has been recruited as executive
        producer for the new Halford project. Halford&#146;s new
        band is called Two, and the upcoming album is titled,
        &#147;Voyeurs.&#148; A United States tour is expected to
        begin in April. Cypress Hill members Sen Dog, B-Real and
        DJ Muggs are back in the studio working on their new
        album together. An official release date has not been
        set. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Radiohead is hitting the United States
        one more time on their &#147;OK Computer&#148; tour. This
        time around they are bringing a few special guests with
        them. Bjork and Spiritualized will be joining Radiohead
        on tour starting March 28. Radiohead are also putting
        together footage for a home video release, but that will
        not be complete until later this year. </font></p>
