        closed since the second week of this quarter. It has been
        on campus for over thirty years, but has had trouble
        holding water in the last several months. </font><p><font size="4">The problems became more serious early this
        quarter when the pool started losing nearly ten inches of
        water each day. Losing that much water is not only
        expensive, but dangerous. The deteriorating pipes were
        leaking the water under the building. The excess water
        could damage the foundation of the entire building. The
        problem started with only the main pipes leaking, but the
        leaks are now effecting the secondary pipes as well. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Hal Gibson, director of Plan Operations
        here at Columbus State University, is overseeing the
        repair process of the pool. He says that there will not
        be any repairs, but a new pool will be installed. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">This project is going to cost nearly a
        quarter of a million dollars. A request is being
        presented funds. If this plan works out, the money will
        be approved and the removal of the old pool will begin in
        the next several weeks. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">If the emergency funds are denied, the
        money will come from the Major Repair and Renovation
        funds, which is an annual allotment of money each year to
        the University. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The new indoor pool should be open
        close to summer quarter. </font></p>
