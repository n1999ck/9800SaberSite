    other day but was unable to due to the blue-gray cloud of cancer-laden smoke drifting
    through the air.</font><p><font size="4">The smoking policy states that smoking outside
    entrances to the buildings is not allowed, yet no one, especially public SAFETY is
    interested in enforcing this policy. As a matter of fact, a friend of mine was personally
    enforcing this by using a water-gun when told by public SAFETY that she had to stop
    bothering the smokers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">Bothering the smokers. What a wild concept. When I went through new
    student orientation in September I was amazed to hear that the new gazebos located in the
    FOB / Howard courtyard were for the comfort and enjoyment of the smokers! Nothing like
    spending taxpayer money on something for the comfort of the smokers. I&#146;ve also been
    told that the smoking policy can&#146;t be enforces until the new signs are posted on the
    buildings apprising smokers of the policy. This poses two more questions: who will enforce
    the policy then and where are the signs? </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">It appears to me, and I am only a senior, that there is a definite
    conflict of interest here. 1.) CSU is a state school funded by taxpayer dollars as well as
    our fees. 2.) The state of Georgia has a current civil lawsuit against the tobacco giants.
    3.) State money is being used to benefit the smokers and in turn punish those who choose
    not to smoke by bombarding us with the more deadly second-hand smoke. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">Why anyone attending school in this day and age has taken up smoking is
    beyond me. Yes, you have the right to smoke, it is not illegal. But when it has been
    proven for over thirty years to kill you it makes me wonder.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">A rule or law that is not enforced may as well not exist.</font></td>
