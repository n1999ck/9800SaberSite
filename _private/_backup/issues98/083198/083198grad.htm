        <td><font size="4"><strong>Going off to college can be
        scary. Imagine not only going away, but also traveling
        half way around the world to a place you&#146;ve never
        been, knowing no one. Imagine again you are Chinese, and
        your home is Macao, the Portuguese colony that will soon
        come under Chinese rule. This was the scenario facing Sun
        I. (Larry) Lei, a graduate student who will receive his
        master&#146;s in business administration in August.</strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong><img src="083198sunlei.jpg" align="left" hspace="0" width="312" height="202"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>When Lei graduates in August there will
        be friendly faces in the crowd: his girlfriend and one of
        his brothers will fly in from Macao for the ceremony.
        Afterwards, they will spend about 15 days traveling in
        the Southeast and up to Washington D.C. before departing
        for Macao, where Lei hopes to work with young people,
        perhaps in a junior college setting, while pursuing his
        CPA certification.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The journey to his
        master&#146;s has been an unusual one. One of eight
        siblings, Lei grew up in what he describes as a
        &#147;poor family.&#148; Typical of such families in
        Macao, he dropped out of regular classes in 1970 after
        completing his primary sixth grade in order to work full
        time to help with family expenses. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Determined to complete his
        education, he took classes in evening school and received
        his high school diploma in 1985. While working part time
        tutoring Cantonese to Southern Baptist missionaries, he
        obtained an application for Columbus College. In 1986 he
        was accepted and arrived in March of 1987 knowing nothing
        about either the school or the city.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Landing in California, he took
        a two-week bus trip cross-country, &#147;not knowing
        where&#148; he would end up, but sightseeing on his way
        to Columbus. His first thought on arrival was,
        &#147;That&#146;s a city?&#148; Macao is the world&#146;s
        densest city with tall buildings and half a million
        people crammed into a very small geographical area. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Thinking &#147;city&#148; as in
        New York City, Lei arrived on campus in the midst of
        regular registration - in the days before computerized
        registration. The cafeteria was filled with tables and
        people standing in lines, but as Lei laughingly says, he
        was &#147;exhausted from the long journey and did not
        want to turn around and go back.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Surviving the registration
        confusion, he settled down to classes and graduated magna
        cum laude in 1990 with a bachelor&#146;s in accounting. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>He returned to Macao and worked
        full time for an evening school while tutoring part-time
        for the Baptist missionaries. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Following his father&#146;s
        death in July of 1997, Lei returned to Columbus to pursue
        a master&#146;s in business administration. In the
        intervening years Columbus College had become Columbus
        State University. Lei was struck by physical changes in
        the campus including the new brick entrances and the now
        complete clock tower and science building. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Reminiscing about his undergrad
        days, he recalls cleaning the bricks that now form the
        clock tower. The campus, although larger in population,
        remains a friendly community where professors care about
        the success of their students, and students are friendly
        and encouraging.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Discussing the differences in
        educational philosophy between China and the U.S., Lei
        points out that Chinese schools emphasize memorization
        and obedience. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The Chinese language is not
        alphabet-based, but rather is a complex series of brush
        strokes forming the numerous characters, all of which
        must be memorized. Here in the states it is more
        important to be creative, to approach problems from
        different angles. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>While he had little problem
        memorizing material for classes, he did encounter
        roadblocks when he first began to apply the facts to
        situations in order to come up with creative analyses or
        solutions.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Not the typical master&#146;s
        program candidate, Lei has gone to classes full time in
        order to complete the requirements in a year. According
        to Lei, he chose to return to the states for his masters
        because new innovations in business come from the U.S.
        His graduate assistantship in the College of Business has
        given him valuable insight into the world of business as
        he learns how the world operates within that sphere.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>CSU&#146;s influence truly
        ranges worldwide, for with Lei&#146;s graduation in
        August the university can boast of a Macao link, soon to
        be a link to China.</strong></font></p>
