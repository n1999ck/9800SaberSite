        at the Lakewood Amphitheater in Atlanta, Georgia, on
        August 20. Dave and company were as impressive as ever,

        Tim Reynolds and Herbie Hancock. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>The show was the band&#146;s second
        appearance in Atlanta this summer, with the first being
