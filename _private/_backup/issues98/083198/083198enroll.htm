        <td><font size="4"><strong>Columbus State University has
        undergone several changes, but never suspected the
        drastic increase in incoming students this year. CSU is
        slowly loosing it&#146;s reputation as a local and
        commuter school. </strong></font><p><font size="4"><strong>Columbus
        State University moved into the 1998-1999 school year
        with many changes in hand with the conversion to both
        Banner and the Semester System. Little did anyone know
        that the enrollment numbers would change as well.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong><img src="083198campus.jpg" align="right" hspace="0" width="244" height="338"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>The number of incoming freshmen at CSU
        has increased by 100 this year. This is a 15% rise from
        last years numbers. This increase is due to a number of
        factors says Shannon Wilson, Acting Director of
        Admissions at Columbus State University. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;The increase is due to
        mainly four factors; the recognition of Columbus State
        University in Atlanta and other surrounding areas, new
        offerings by CSU such as the Space Science Center, the
        addition of another recruiter, Susan Webb, to the
        Admissions Staff and the CSU C.O.R.E.&#148;, says Wilson.
        </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Last Fall, roughly 660 new
        freshmen attended Columbus State University and this Fall
        the numbers are up around 760 students. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Wilson states, &#147;This can
        definitely be a plus for student life since the freshman
        this year seem interested to get involved more.&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dr. Carl Wallman, Dean of
        Admissions and Registrar, feels positive about the
        transition to the semester as a whole even though the
        school did experience things that were not anticipated.
        Columbus State University successfully completed the
        conversion to the semester system this fall. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Dr. Wallman says, &#147;We are
        excited about finally being able to get through what we
        have anticipated for so long. Even though we have gone
        over the hump, there is still lots of work to be
        done.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Kim Padgett, an Admissions
        Counselor in the Admission Office, is excited as well
        about the increase in numbers.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>Padgett states, &#147;When I
        came to CSU, the school was more of a commuter college,
        but I feel as if we are moving away from that reputation
        as we move toward the future.&#148; </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>The freshman class this year
        seems more enthusiastic and more willing to get involved
        that in the past. Student Activities has played a large
        part in that with the display of events this past week. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>&#147;Getting the students here
        is half the battle, but retaining them is a different
        issue. Everyone needs to work together to give the
        students the best services we can provide,&#148; added
        Padgett.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><strong>As Columbus State University
        moves toward higher standards, so to does it move toward
        larger numbers on campus. Everyone on campus plays a
        large part in these change of events and it will take a
        team effort to keep this type of environment on campus
        for the years to come. </strong></font></p>
