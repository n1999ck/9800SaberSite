                <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial">I
                feel that some professors are confused about the
                semester system. They are trying to jam too much
                into the days we spend with them. I have one
                professor in the language department that is
                trying to adjust to the semester system, but it
                is very difficult for her and her students to do
                this in such a short amount of time. The sad
                thing is, for people who have never taken a
                foreign language, they are having to jump right
                in instead of the small steps that they could
                take on the quarter system. Both professors and
                students this semester are guinea pigs in this
                whole semester system experiment. As a Student
                Government representative, I have had other
                students express these same concerns about
                foreign language.</font></p>

                <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial">I
                think that there is a period of adjustment. The
                students are having to adjust as well as the
                faculty. All of us need to get used to the pace
                before we can really judge how well our teachers
                are doing.</font></p>

                <p><font color="#0000EB" size="5" face="Arial"><strong>Do
                you think that professors are overloading classes
                with too much work for students to handle?</strong></font></p>
                <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial">The
                semester system is supposed to help the students
                absorb the materials better and provide plenty of
                time to work on assignments. Yet, professors
                think that since the students have a longer term,
                they can bombard them with projects. Most of the
                time these projects are due during the semester
                and not at the end. I&#146;m a business major and
                I am taking six classes. One of my classes is
                requiring eight group projects during this
                semester. If the University System is expecting
                the students to take at least five classes per
                semester, I&#146;m asking: How do they think we
                should manage this with this much work for
                students to handle? I can understand that CSU
                professors are inexperienced with the semester
                system, but it is insane to overload students
                with projects. </font></p>

                Clinton-Lewinsky issue. Is it appropriate to
                spend the nation's time on this?</strong></font></p>
                <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial">I think it&#146;s great that
                American women have modernized to the point where
                they can accept a man&#146;s little infidelities.
                It&#146;s only natural, from a biological
                perspective, for a man who has fought his way to
                the head of the pack (the Alpha male, so to
                speak) to want to breed with as many eligible
                females as possible. The fact that the current
                President of the United States of America is a
                bald-faced liar is somewhat harder to accept.
                This tendency for fabrication has been a Clinton
                character flaw since his early days in Arkansas
                politics. Trustworthiness should be one of the
                foremost attributes of the leader of the most
                important nation in the world but Clinton views
                the truth as a liability. Now he&#146;s the
                liability.</font></p>

                <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial">As far as I&#146;m concerned, what
                they do or did is none of my business. There are
                bigger tragedies in THIS country alone to be
                concerned about. Why focus on an affair someone
                else has or had if it was in a room without a
                view or video camera? Besides, if Monica has lied
                before what makes anyone think she isn&#146;t
                now? Does the government own the Sun, we do not
                know it? Okay, so he&#146;s the president. And?
                His morals? Those hold true only to himself.
                Everyone defines moral differently in every case.
                All I can say is either fire the man so we can
                all go on with our lives or leave him alone, so
                he can go on running the country that he has thus
                far done well doing. If I actually had time to
                give my full attention to this situation, I would
                say &#147;Hey! Stop wasting my time and money,
