        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Well, hello there. I hope everybody is having a good week
        so far. This is going to be a little bit different this week ... I am just going to
        ramble. I&#146;ve got some things that I need to get off my chest, and hey, I&#146;m
        getting paid for this too. Can&#146;t beat that with a wet noodle, can ya&#146;?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It has been a crazy time for me in the past few months.
        Heck, the past week has been insane. We all have so many choices to make everyday, and
        they all bleed over into someone&#146;s life besides our own. I wish that maybe we could
        stop and see what the consequences of our actions would be before we did some of the crazy
        stuff we do. I suppose things would be a whole lot easier then. Of course, then life would
        not be nearly as interesting.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I guess what started this whole &#147;I better look at my
        life&#148; kick I am on right now is something that happened three weeks ago. I, along
        with many others, lost a friend recently, who took his own life. Something big was
        bothering him and it was bothering him in a big way. I saw him the day before he died, and
        did not notice that something was wrong.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">That is my point - we see each other every day, but what do
        we notice about each other? Do we even care to notice? Sometimes I don&#146;t. I need to.
        We all need to. To the friend I&#146;ve lost: I am sorry.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Recently there have been several things going on in my life
        that ended with somebody getting hurt. I am sorry that things have happened the way they
        did, but I am sure they happened for some reason - other than the simple and obvious
        reason that I am an idiot. Life goes on.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Okay, Okay, Okay, I&#146;ll bring this to an end, but first
        I want to point out a song, a poem actually, but it is getting played on the radio a lot
        these days. This song touches on many of the issues to which we all need to pay a little
        attention. I do.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>&#147;Everybody Is Free&#148; - performed by Baz
        Luhrmann and Quindon Tarver written by Mary Schmich</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&#147;Ladies and gentlemen of the class of &#145;99: Wear
        sunscreen. If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. The
        long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my
        advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this
        advice now. Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, never mind. You will not
        understand the power and beauty of your youth until they&#146;ve faded. But trust me, in
        20 years, you&#146;ll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can&#146;t
        grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are
        not as fat as you imagine. Don&#146;t worry about the future. Or worry, but know that
        worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The
        real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the
        kind that blinded you at 4PM on some idle Tuesday. Do one thing every day that scares you.
        Sing. Don&#146;t be reckless with other people&#146;s hearts. Don&#146;t put up with
        people who are reckless with yours. Floss. Don&#146;t waste your time on jealousy.
        Sometimes you&#146;re ahead, sometimes you&#146;re behind. The race is long and, in the
        end, it&#146;s only with yourself. Remember compliments you receive. Forget the insults.
        If you succeed in doing this, tell me how. Keep your old love letters. Throw away your old
        bank statements. Stretch. Don&#146;t feel guilty if you don&#146;t know what you want to
        do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn&#146;t know at 22 what they
        wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still
        don&#146;t. Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees. You&#146;ll miss them when
        they&#146;re gone. Maybe you&#146;ll marry, maybe you won&#146;t. Maybe you&#146;ll have
        children, maybe you won&#146;t. Maybe you&#146;ll divorce at 40, maybe you&#146;ll dance
        the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary. Whatever you do, don&#146;t
        congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance.
        So are everybody else&#146;s.&nbsp; Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don&#146;t
        be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. It&#146;s the greatest instrument
        you&#146;ll ever own. Dance. Even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room. Read
        the directions, even if you don&#146;t follow them. Do not read beauty magazines. They
        will only make you feel ugly. Get to know your parents. You never know when they&#146;ll
        be gone for good. Be nice to your siblings. They&#146;re your best link to your past and
        the people most likely to stick with you in the future. Understand that friends come and
        go, but with a precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography
        and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when
        you were young. Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. Live in
        Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft. Travel. Accept certain
        inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will philander. You, too, will get old.
        And when you do, you&#146;ll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable,
        politicians were noble, and children respected their elders. Respect your elders.
        Don&#146;t expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund. Maybe
        you&#146;ll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when either one might run out.
        Don&#146;t mess too much with your hair or by the time you&#146;re 40 it will look 85. Be
        careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of
        nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off,
        painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it&#146;s worth. But trust me
        on the sunscreen.&#148;</font></p>
