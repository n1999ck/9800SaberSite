        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Show me the money!</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When I began doing research for this article I had no idea
        that I would wind up in the middle of something so complicated. All I wanted to do was to
        find out how much of Student Government &#145;s money could be used for organizational
        needs on this campus. Do yourself a favor- don&#146;t go looking for any answers in the
        SGA office. They can barely agree on what kind of coffee to drink.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I have received conflicting information from people who are
        supposed to be working together to help the student body. For example, I went seeking
        information about the SGA budget. As a member of a social organization of this campus, I
        have always thought that SGA had some money set aside that organizations could request.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Want to know what I found out? SGA has a yearly budget of
        $30,000. After looking over a copy of the 1999-2000 Student Government budget it became
        clear that $14,000 of this budget is set aside for supplies, events, and organizational
        needs. Well, surprise, surprise. According to certain persons in the SGA office, this is
        simply not true. No amount of the budget was ever meant to be set aside for organizational
        needs. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Organizations have received some money as a courtesy over
        the past couple of years. I&#146;m sorry... I must have been mistaken...poor little
        ole&#146; me, I must have forgotten how to read. Here is a direct quote for a copy of the
        1999-2000 Student Government budget that I received from someone in the SGA office
        (don&#146;t worry boys, it&#146;s all about freedom of information).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&#147;Account #95-30-1-31-101-000-71400&#148; This account
        is for all supplies, events, and (this is a shock) ORGANIZATIONAL NEEDS. It started out
        with $14,000 for the school year of 1998-1999. Supplies have been purchased from places
        such as K-Mart, Wal-Mart, and Chapman&#146;s. $3,000 of this money was used for the 1999
        Homecoming Ball at the Bradley Theatre.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I have documentation of eight organizations that have
        requested money from Student Government this year. Of these eight, three organizations
        were denied and none of the organizations received the full amount they requested. Some of
        the organizations that received money even had their own budget. Less than $1100 has been
        given out, according to my documentation, since February 2, 1999. If this doesn&#146;t
        upset you, it should.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">So where did the rest of the money go? Well, I want you to
        go find out for yourself (be aware that you will probably be told everything is DYNAMITE,
        ain&#146;t that right J.J.)? </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">First of all, I think campus organizations should make an
        effort to become aware of the services that are available to them. From what I understand
        the whole concept of the SGA forum has become a joke. For those of you that don&#146;t
        know...SGA is made up of elected executive members, elected senators, and appointed
        representatives from the various organizations on campus. The executive council must
        pre-approve (or in many cases pre-disapprove) any document that will be voted upon before
        it can go before the forum. Once in the forum the executive council will make its
        recommendation to the forum and they vote. What is so sad is that the majority of the
        senators and representatives are in such a hurry to get out of there that they don&#146;t
        even question the executive council&#146;s recommendation. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">You are probably thinking, wait a minute... I thought she
        was angry at the executive council. I am angry with all the parties involved. I put my
        trust in my representative to act in the best interest of my organization while in the SGA
        forum. How can she though, when questions are not encouraged and everyone seems to think
        that what the executive council says goes (Hey... that sounds good to me, you ready to go
        grab a beer). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">According to one source, even if a person does question the
        recommendation of the executive council it may damage their ability to get further
        business passed (there&#146;s no reason to hold a grudge...can&#146;t we just kiss and
        make up). Even worse, the executive council, according to my sources, has never made an
        effort to educate the senators and representatives about the policies and procedures
        involved in these types of meetings. We are told that we must have a representative at
        each meeting. They will have one recognized vote and if they miss more than two meetings
        then that organization will not be recognized on this campus! Off with their heads!!!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This is a two way street. The student body has much more
        power than they realize. Stop complaining and go find out what exactly the rules are.
        Don&#146;t take someone&#146;s word for it just because they convinced 77 people to vote
        last year to elect them into office. That&#146;s right, only 77 people voted in the
        election last year. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Speaking of those who are in office, don&#146;t think I am
        not grateful for all the work that you do. There are tons of things that our executive
        members do behind the scenes that the average student is not aware of. We are
        grateful...extremely grateful. But...(oh you knew it was coming), I would much rather you
        be interested in me as a person. How many of you take the time to actually listen to the
        opinion of the ordinary student. We may be misinformed and un- involved, but when someone
        you have never met tries to tell you that there is a problem with your job you should
        listen to the underlying meaning. Bottom line... the students (those of us who give a
        damn) are unhappy with certain things. We need clarification on certain facts, not just
        your usual line of bull. I have no interest on engaging in a conversation with someone
        whose soul direction is to make me feel like I am a complete idiot. Enough said- I think I
        have made my point. I would just like to say that I wish the students were more interested
        in what happens on this campus, and I wish that the powers that be were more interested in
        the average student. We can&#146;t complain about things on campus and not do anything
        about it. You have a voice... use it. For those to whom we give the power to work for us
        can also use the power to work against us. I will end by quoting the campaign speech I
        received from a person running for senator, &#147;Vote for me... I promise I will try to
        go to at least half of the meetings.&#148;</font></p>
