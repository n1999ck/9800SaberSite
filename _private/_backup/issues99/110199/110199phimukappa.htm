            <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
            </font><font face="Arial" size="2">	Columbus State University’s first ever Sorority Bowl was held this past Wednesday at the
            Intramural Fields and was sponsored by Intramural Sports.  The two teams that played were Phi Mu Kappa’s Lions and the Delta Zeta Snapping Turtles.</font>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This game of flag football followed all the rules that are regularly set by
            Intramural Sports here at CSU.  There were two halves at thirty minutes each.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Phi Mu Kappa kicked off for the first half but neither team could seem to get things going.  The first half ended with the score still 0-0.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, the second half was were all the excitement happened.  Kelly Carden, the quarterback for Phi Mu Kappa, and Molly Leckrone, a running back, both made touchdowns to put Phi Mu Kappa on the
            </font>b<font face="Arial" size="2">oard.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Turtles tried to come back with an interception that was made by Ellen Stewart, but they couldn’t get on the board.  Amber Miller of the Lions also made an interception.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Kelly Carden was chosen as the Most Valuable Player.  Her throwing and running skills helped win her team the trophy.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Time eventually ran out for the Turtles and Phi Mu Kappa took home the trophy.  There were many friends and family that came out to support each team.  They all agreed that both teams played exceptionally well.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The spectators added a special atmosphere to the game with their cameras and horns and a variety of cheers.  Dr. Larry
            Kees commented that he was extremely pleased with the turn out.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There may be some concern that this sport is still dangerous even though there is no
            tackling.  The most common injury that occurs is a jammed finger, and only one player suffered from this injury, Gari-Leigh Foreman.  She is fine and is looking forward to playing again.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The lack of injuries and the quality of the play was due largely to the amount of time that the teams practiced.  Both teams practiced on their own and then with their perspective coaches two week before the game.  Both coaches agreed that the women were determined to be in top condition for the game.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The two teams will likely meet again at the end of the season.  Phi Mu Kappa is planning on playing a team from the
            Baptist Student Union sometime in the near future.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Members of Phi Mu Kappa expressed how the game helped to boost moral for their organization.  The sororities rarely get to compete on the this level and both teams agreed that it was worth it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Robin Remich of Phi Mu Kappa stated, “We can get out there and get our hands dirty and play football.”  Remich also commented on the fact that she felt that her teams strong defense contributed primarily to their victory.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Combined with the skills of their quarterback, Kelly, this team looks to be a hard one to beat.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Eli Cain of the Lions stated, “I think we were more focused on having fun...and that is exactly what we did.”&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The game was flag football and these ladies came to play.  Flag football is different from regular football because there is no touching allowed.  Without the extreme physical aspect of the game one would think that this game, two female teams, was less then thrilling.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On the contrary, according to Mike Speight the coach for the Lions, “These ladies played with more spirit then the men.  Of course the skill level is different, but the spirit and intensity was higher.  They gained knowledge of the game and...I can’t say enough how much fun they had.”&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Speight went on to say that the women played with great sportsmanship but more importantly they had fun.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Jason Stroble, the coach for the Turtles, commented on the game, “It was good clean fun and the girls played hard and had a lot of fun...we hope that more women will want to get involved.”  		According to Speight and Stroble there are two women who currently play with the men and they are hoping that more
            independent players will come together to form female teams.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	All in all the game was an exciting experience and one that everyone hopes will become a tradition.  Hopefully this game will start an annual Sorority Bowl to be held each year in the fall.  Until then the regular season will continue until the end of the semester.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Congratulations Phi Mu Kappa  on a job well done!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Members of the Lions:  Emily Jones, Eli Cain, Molly Leckrone, Robin Remich, Stephanie Roberts, Carla Santiago, Amber Miller, Stacey Floyd, Christina Barron, and Most Valuable Player - Kelly Carden.<br>
	Members of the Turtles:  Jamie Smith, Lindsey Griffin, Christie Morrell, Holly Sumner, Cathy Hand, Marcie Self, Ellen Stewart, Gari-Leigh Foreman, and Amanda McLean.</font></p>
