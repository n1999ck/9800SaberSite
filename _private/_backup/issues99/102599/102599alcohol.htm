            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	This week Columbus State joined college campuses across the country in recognizing National Collegiate Alcohol Awareness Week.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	This year’s observance featured activities, speakers, and displays educating students about alcohol and its effects. The events were planned by the cultural affairs committee of the Student Programming Council, in cooperation with the CSU Office of Public Safety.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Throughout the week a wrecked automobile adorned with a story of a teen who lost her life in a drunk driving accident sat outside the Davidson Center. Organizers stated that the car’s purpose was to encourage students to think before they considered driving drunk.<br>
	Another event held this week was the controlled drinking demonstration. Two students, over the age of 21, drank for a specified amount of time and had their response times tested.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The tests were conducted by an officer from the Columbus Police Department and Jasper Cooke, director of Public Safety.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The two students that participated in the drinking demonstration were Stephanie Adams and Tim Lester. Adams and Lester drank for the two hours proceeding the demonstration and were then brought before the audience. 	Both were asked to perform a variety of sobriety tests including walking in a straight line and keeping their balance as they stood on one foot. Adams and Lester also took breathalizer tests, with Lester scoring a .09 and Adams scoring a .071.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I had a lot of fun and I’m glad that I had an opportunity to participate because I learned a lot about the effects of drinking. For example, I learned that your tolerance has nothing to do with your actual blood alcohol content,” said Adams.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to Adams, “We were required to drink slowly over several hours so we didn’t feel intoxicated.  My alcohol level was lower than Tim’s because I ate lunch and he didn’t. This doesn’t mean that food will slow down how fast you get drunk, it just slows down how fast it gets in your system.”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Delta Zeta sorority encouraged students to create fun and non-alcoholic drinks in their Mocktails competition that was sponsored Thursday night.  The competition included prizes for those organizations and student groups who participated including best theme, presentation and best tasting.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Phi Mu Kappa won the award for most creative presentation while Alpha Kappa Alpha won for best theme. Xi Theta was awarded prizes for best tasting and best overall presentation.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Cecilia Clark, advisor of SPC and director of student activities, stated that she was “happy with the crowd” at this year’s events. She also stated that she hope that “the whole campus will get involved in events like this in the future.”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In correlation with Collegiate Alcohol Awareness week, the Counseling Center has begun offering an interactive online program which steers students through a variety of drinking situations and allows them to make decisions as to what drinks to ingest.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The program begins by asking students to define themselves based on age, weight, height, and sex. The program then takes the participant into a virtual party and allows them to choose what drinks they want.&nbsp;<br>
	A tally on the side of the screen keeps up with how many drinks are ingested and what the person’s BAC is at that time. It also shows a clock counting down the time it would take for that person to return to .000 BAC.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The interactive program also includes facts about college drinking as determined by recent surveys. The program was created and is maintained by the University of Illinois and the Century Council which is based in Los Angeles.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To access the Alcohol 101 program through the Columbus State website, click on the CSU public menu on the computer desktop, click on the CSU library CD-Rom, go to the CD-Rom programs, and find Alcohol 101.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	In the state of Georgia any person under the age of 21 can not have a BAC level over .02. Persons over the age of 21 who exceed .08 are considered to be over the legal limit and may lose their license and be eligible for jail time.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	For more information about the legal limits of alcohol and what the consequences may be stop by the Public Safety Department in the Davidson Center and pick up a brochure.
