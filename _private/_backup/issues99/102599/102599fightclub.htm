	Let me start off by saying that I loved Fight Club.  I loved it for many reasons. Ed Norton is brilliant.  Brad Pitt is good. The idea of a fight club is awesome. I have a friend, Matt, and we continually beat the stuffing out of each other. He has more stuffing than I do, but the ironic part is that I always end up losing more stuffing than he does.&nbsp;<br>
	Who cares? It is fun – so I  may have bruises and bleed a little sometimes – Matt is not going to kill me. Anyway, this is my pick for the movie of the year, so I want you to hear about it. The following review is a press release not written by me, so enjoy it. . .<br>
            <br>
            Fight Club--a review by “Cinemaphile”  (Very positive--no spoilers.)<br>
	“First and foremost, let me give you one word of advice. At any cost, avoid any review, article, tidbit, script, book, ANYTHING regarding Fight Club that does not state flat out “no spoilers.” This is a movie you do not  want to know too much about going into. Enjoy the surprises.</font>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">That being said, let me put this in the simplest terms possible: Pretend it’s late March 2000. The envelopes, please! Best Picture: Fight Club. Best Actor: Edward Norton, Fight Club. Best Supporting Actor: Brad Pitt,  Fight Club. Best Cinematography, Editing, Adapted Screenplay: Fight Club, Fight Club, Fight Club. Granted, there are many more promising candidates yet to be released, but I would be hard pressed to find any film that will blow me away the way this film has.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Director David Fincher has taken Chuck Palahniuk’s novel and created an amazing, grungy, surreal tale in true Fincher fashion. The cinematography and editing style are characters unto themselves, and are nothing short of phenomenal. Every extra, every sound, every visual effect draws us deeper, more convincingly into the madness of his world.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Edward Norton is at his best, as the narrator and protagonist of the story, and Brad Pitt seems to be back in full Jeffrey Goines persona from his (Oscar-nominated, Golden Globe-winning) performance in 12 Monkeys.  I cannot say enough about this film. I was amazed, perplexed, exhilarated, exhausted, excited...</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Some critics are saying that this film is socially irresponsible and that it portrays violence as a good thing. Well, I won’t lie. It probably is and yes, it does. It deals with returning to our primal selves. Escaping the confines of civilization and organization. The prison we’ve built around ourselves with technology, schedules, marketing.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is not a film for everyone. Its disturbing, violent images and not-quite-ideal moral standards will most likely  make a lot of people upset. But for those of you who understand the meaning of “fiction,” you will be treated to one of the best films to come along in years.<br>
	Intricate, well-defined, flawed characters created by Palahniuk, so expertly portrayed by Norton, Pitt, and the entire cast, under the guidance of one of the most exciting, innovative directors of this generation . . . I would have to say this is one of the few perfect films I’ve seen, and definitely THE best I’ve seen in years.”</font></td>
