            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Columbus State University, the fine institution that we are so privileged to go to, seems to have everything on campus under control.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	There is no danger of being harmed by what lurks in the numerous amount of bushes and no real fear of anything else.  The staff is so kind and sweet, and so is the wonderful administration.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	To make sure this utopia runs smoothly, that wonderful administration and staff make sure we all have copies of the student handbook that was so nicely written.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	However, in the process, someone forgot to remember that rules have to be enforced, not just put there for us by our reigning superiors for us to see.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Now, really.  Is it my mistake or does the handbook clearly state that there is to be NO SMOKING NEAR ANY OF THE BUILDINGS?&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	For such a beautiful campus, how are we supposed to enjoy a breath of fresh CSU air if we are constantly served a big lung-full of second-hand smoke too?&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I know we are supposed to learn to share space with others.  For weeks, I have tried to accept this reasoning and believe that this is an adult setting; adults know how to act in public.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	What I am seeing is a bunch of people acting like children that have not learned how to read yet.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	People, the handbook is written in standard English, if you need a translation, I can tell you this:  “Smoking in this area is not allowed, meaning you can not do it near buildings.”  You know, buildings, those tall things you enter to learn everyday?&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I can only assume that the nicotine is to blame for them not understanding. Maybe the constant inhalation of their own smoke has zapped their brains so badly that they are incapable of reading one simple rule and following it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, I can not blame them completely.  They are being allowed to do as they please since the administration around here does not seem to have enough energy to enforce one of their own creations.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I guess they don’t mind letting the rest of us choke on the invention of these walking chimneys.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I guess it is safe to assume that we should only fear the wrath of this school on paper. That is, considering that this is the only time they seriously stand behind these rules.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Still, the CSU cannot be blamed for this either.  They allow us to be here and feel at home.  They don’t want us to feel like we are constantly being watched.  Well, guess what--you not at home.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	So, whom can we blame?  Well, young people make good decisions, but they sometimes need the older generation to set a positive example for them so that BETTER decisions can be made.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I have noticed that the older part is not exactly caring about this.&nbsp;<br>
	It’s good to want to be on friendly terms with the youthful, but that does not mean that they have to encourage this bad habit to blend in.  Wisdom is supposed to come with age.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	From just looking around me, I see that some of you have must have a lot of
            “wisdom.”  Apparently that is not good enough for you to have the common sense to influence and discourage young people from smoking.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Instead, you happily join in as if you want to educate them on the right way to get away with it.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Do you really like invading the space of us, the people who do care, so you can blend in and feel young again? Or is it that you are so nervous about fitting in that you and the young ones need the cigarette to make you feel more at easy, cool maybe?&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I can offer a few alternatives that should work better.  You ever heard of NERVE GUM.  Better yet, since Christmas, is coming up, I suggest you ask for some
            Nicorette.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You may not care two cents about my hot air, but I couldn’t care less about your nasty smoking habit.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	It is filthy.  It is against the rules and you really should not talk to near someone after doing it.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Know what I mean?</font></td>
