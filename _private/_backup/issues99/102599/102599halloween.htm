            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Halloween, a holiday that has always conjured up images of ghosts and goblins is fast approaching, and with it comes the folklore of the origins of the celebration. The ‘day of the dead’ as it is sometimes called has a history that reaches back to the pre-Christian era when pagans celebrated and revered their lives and those of loved ones that had already died.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For the early Celtic people who lived over 2000 years ago, Samhain, meaning summer’s end, was a celebration that began on November 1. On the eve of Samhain, the people would gather the last harvest of the year and join together to celebrate their wealth.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	As a part of the celebration, the people would gather in the town for a large feast. Cattle were slain and their bones were tossed into a great fire, what is now known as a bonfire. As the great fire raged, all other fires in the town were extinguished.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	Celtic people believed that on the eve of Samhain, the dead returned to the places in which they lived. To welcome the dead, people ceremoniously put out food and drink for those spirits that might return. They also left windows and doors open for the spirits to have free passage into their home.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Although the people wanted to welcome the spirits home, they did not want any unfriendly spirits entering their houses. Therefore the tradition began of carving the images of spirit-guardians into turnips and setting them outside homes.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Celtic tradition is not all dark, though. On the eve of Samhain, young people would dress up in strange disguises pretending to be the returning dead and spirits. The act of bobbing for apples also came from the Celts. The tradition refers to the “Paradise of  Apples” where the dead, having eaten the sacred fruit, enjoyed immortality. The people would bob for the apples hoping to increase their chances of living in the realm of the immortal.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	As of 837, November 1 became known as the Feast of All Saints and October 31, the eve of the Feast, became known as Hallow E’en.&nbsp;<br>
	Throughout the rest of the world, celebrations that are similar to Halloween are celebrated during the year.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In England, people celebrate Guy Fawkes Day on November 5. Fawkes was  accused of attempting to blow up the House of Parliament on that day on 1605. In 1606, the House declared the 5th to be a day of public thanksgiving. In present day England, children celebrate the day by preparing effigies of Fawkes, dummies known as Guys. They place dummies on the streets and beg for a ‘penny for the Guy.’ On the eve of November 5, the dummies are burned in large bonfires throughout the country.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Mexico and other Latin American countries also celebrate a form of Halloween called the Days of the Dead, or El Dias de los Muertos. The celebration begins on November 1st and last for two days. Activities include giving away candy and toys. People also celebrate by decorating the graves of family
            members.&nbsp; Unlike other celebrations where people fear the dead, this holiday is one of the recognition and celebration of death and the remembrance of dead individuals.
