            As of Thursday of last week, rock and roll legend Johnny Cash is battling pneumonia, only one year after nearly dying from the illness. Cash, 67, was listed in serious condition last week in a Nashville hospital. Hospital spokeswoman Jessica Etz spoke to MTV News about Cash, saying, “he is still in serious condition, but he is improving. His life is not in danger.”</font>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Cash was hospitalized twice in 1998 for pneumonia, and that is just one of the health problems that he has had in recent years.  In 1997, he cancelled a book signing tour when he was diagnosed with Shy-Drager Syndrome, a neurological condition related to Parkinson’s Disease. Since then, he has made only one public appearance, at an all-star tribute concert honoring his career. Bruce Springsteen, Dave Matthews, and U2 were among the performers that honored Cash at this event.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The apparent demise of my favorite pop group occurred almost one year ago. Now they are back – sort of.  Toad the Wet Sprocket called it quits, but now offer us a look back at the band’s entire career with the new album “P.S. (A Toad Retrospective).” The compilation, which hits stores on November 9, includes the group’s greatest hits, plus some of their personal favorite tracks, and two previously unreleased songs.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One of the new tracks is called “P.S.,” and it gives a little hope that maybe the band is not gone for good. The band regrouped in the studio to record the song especially for this album. I guess we will just have to wait and see. If they are really done, than I want to thank Toad The Wet Sprocket for many good albums and a job well done.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">H</font><font face="Arial" size="2">ere is the track list for the Retrospective:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“P.S.” (new version)<br>
