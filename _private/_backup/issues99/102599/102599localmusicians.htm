            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Steven Roach and songwriting partner Johnny Viggins were awarded Honorable Mention at the 21st Annual Georgia Music Industry Association Songwriting Showcase.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The song is “Here We Go,” and it is their first entry into the world of song writing contests. As a result, Steve and Johnny are continuing to enter songwriting competitions. Their next entry is in the John Lennon Songwriting Contest based in New Jersey.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Steve and Johnny, both Columbus residents, met in the local band Signal several years ago. Steve, formerly a drummer of No Promises, joined Signal and played with them for about 6 months and left.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	However, while playing together they began tossing some song ideas around which would later come together as their first song around October of 1998. They’ve been getting together on odd weekends since then to write and record at Steve’s home studio.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Steve, a graduate of the Communication program, is working at Columbus State University as a distance learning facilitator while Johnny is a supervisor with a local construction firm.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Johnny can also be seen playing guitar for Solar Grin at Columbus music venues. Steve, however, has put away his drumsticks and sold his drums in favor of concentrating on songwriting and recording; his last playing was done playing part time for Cornbread at six of their out-of-town shows.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Steve is not sure if he will pick up drumming again, but is busy enough working on current projects with Johnny.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Plans for the future include the continuation of songwriting, entering competitions, and performing their originals live. Also, they  are wrapping up the final recording of material to go onto an upcoming CD; it should enter post -production around December and see local release around spring of 2000.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For further information, contact Steve Roach at 569-8060 (leave message and he will get back with you promptly).</font></p>
