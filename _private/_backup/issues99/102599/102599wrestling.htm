            One of the most exciting tag teams that we have seen in years is set to return to the ring this Monday Night at Nitro. The “West Hollywood Blondes,” Lenny and Lodi will most likely be involved with the new character The Maestro. The Maestro is expected to become more developed in the weeks to come. I believe that Lenny and Lodi should probably be in line for the tag belts in the near future, but it is not clear if the Maestro will be a friend or foe of the Blondes.&nbsp;</font>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The new controller of WCW Vince Russo is said to be working on a HUGE angle for Kimberly, but he is also considering removing her from the Nitro Girls, in order to allow her more time to devote to her character. It looks as though Russo will also allow WCW to show more of their women – Tori, Kimberly, and Mona, and I do mean more of them in a sense of, well, more of them. We saw this begin with the “Evening Gown” match between Mona and
            Medusa last week.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thursday Night Thunder will be moving its taping to Tuesdays starting in December. This will allow for the bigger stars that appear on Nitro to also appear on Thunder. It is also being looked into whether or not WCW should keep Thunder on a Thursday, or possibly move it to Wednesday, in order to help the show’s struggling ratings.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The boost in ratings for Nitro this week might influence a decision on whether to cut
            Nitro back to 2 hours.  Vince Russo is pushing for the cut, because he believes a two hour show would allow for a fresher product.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In what I call the best moment we have had in wrestling this year, Jeff Jarrett jumped ship and appeared in WCW last week. He began a feud with Buff Bagwell and possibly Lex Luger.  Jeff Jarrett appeared on WCW Live! last week and said his reasons for leaving the WWF could be summed up in two words, “Jim Ross”.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Jarrett said he was not happy with the way Ross was handling the negotiations for renewal of his WWF contract, and that Ross gave him the impression that there wasn’t a spot for him in the WWF.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">WWF wrestler Droz was dropped on his head two weeks ago by D Lo Brown, an accident of course, but since then Droz has been paralyzed from the waist down. Droz has gained some feeling back in his feet and lower legs, and doctors see a full recovery in the future. Good luck
            Droz.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Look for WWF’s Mick Foley, aka Mankind/Cactus Jack/Dude Love, to start helping put other guys over. This may start with a feud with Val Venis. I think this is a respectable thing for Foley to do and is a great help to the business.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> And finally, look for the NWO to reform soon, if WCW can come to terms with Hulk Hogan.  Kevin Nash has stated, “we are getting the band back together.” This leads me to believe that the original group will be reforming soon, with Eric Bischoff possibly being written into the script as the manager, or mastermind behind the bad guys. Even though Bischoff is no longer running WCW, I believe he has a great character, and it would be a waste not to use him in the wrestling business.
