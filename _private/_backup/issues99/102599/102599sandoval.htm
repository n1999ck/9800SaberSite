            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The Columbus State University’s Art Department is currently showcasing “The Fiber Art of Arturo Sandoval” from October 11-November 2 in the fine arts gallery.  The Art Department is not only displaying Arturo’s work, but sponsoring his visit to the school for a week through the visiting artists program.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> Mr. Sandoval is currently the faculty artist at the University of Kentucky and his artistic focus is on mixed media fibers.  Arturo arrived for a reception in his honor on October 19 in the fine arts gallery. At the reception he explained each piece of his artwork and answered questions raised by the public.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Arturo’s art consists of machine stitching of mixed media fibers with different interlacing techniques in order to create his individual art expressions.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Some of his art works are web sculptures which are woven and made with different fibers. The interesting part about the webs are that they are capable of being sculpted into many different shapes.  At the reception Arturo encouraged the public to lift the web and sculpt it into what they thought it should look like.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	On October 21, Arturo also gave a lecture about his artistic expression and how he creates his pieces.  Some of the themes he uses for his artwork are the sky, water, issues of American politics, terrorism and the approaching millennium.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The exhibit that is currently at Columbus State deals with the millennium and American politics.  Arturo has also been visiting art classes throughout the week of his visitation to teach the art majors some of his own techniques as well as broaden their outlook on different types of art. The exhibit is open for viewing for 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays through November 2.
