            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Ellen Najjar, this week’s Campus Candid, was a great person to interview because of her positive, outgoing personality.  Ellen is a freshman here at CSU.  She is a music major and plays violin in the orchestra.  In fact, Columbus State’s highly reputable music program is the reason she decided to attend CSU.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Born on the fourth of July, Ellen has lived in Atlanta, Georgia her whole life with her mother, father, older sister, younger brother, and her 2-year-old cat named Panther.  Naturally, as a native to the Atlanta area, Ellen is a huge Braves fan.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Ellen began playing the violin in the sixth grade. Her ideal plans for after graduation are “playing in a major symphony orchestra and hopefully one day being a soloist.” Now that Ellen’s love of playing the violin is such an important part of her life, she thinks it is funny when she admits, “I only started playing the violin because a couple of my friends were playing the violin.”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Needless to say, Ellen loves music.  She calls listening to the radio her “ultimate favorite hobby.”  Her favorite piece of violin music is Tchaikovsky’s violin concerto.  However, she also enjoys alternative and “top forty” music.  She says that Smash Mouth is one of her favorite bands.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Besides music, Ellen’s other hobbies include swimming, writing, and “hanging out with friends and relaxing.”  Ellen also said, “I love exercising, but I don’t get to do it that much.  On the weekends I climb Stone Mountain.”&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	As for movies, Ellen says “Legends of the Fall has always been one of my favorites,” but she also likes As Good as it Gets and Cinderella.  Her favorite foods include chicken fajitas, macaroni and cheese, and chocolate cake.  The Varsity in Atlanta is her favorite restaurant.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Though Ellen likes college so far, she did have a rather embarrassing moment on the first day of orchestra rehearsal.  She “lost track of time filling out credit card applications to get free T-shirts.”  When she walked in to rehearsal “everyone was sitting quietly in their chairs listening to the conductor and they all stared at me.”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So far, Ellen’s favorite things about going to college is her freedom and “being able to move at my own pace.”  Ellen likes Columbus and says that because there’s “not much to do,” there is also “nothing to distract me from my music.”</font></p>
