	The following column, entitled “Luse’s Losers,” will deal with the picking of the losing team in the upcoming week’s SEC football games. It will be a cynical twist to the way everyone calls the sport.  Practically no one ever picks the losing teams, so I will take that challenge upon myself to successfully pick the losing team each week in the SEC and try and predict the score as well.  In dealing with the last four weeks worth of games, I currently have a record of 39-22.  So I am not too bad at picking the losing team. So here is this weeks LUSE’S LOSERS.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Game # 1<br>
            Alabama vs. Southern Mississippi</b><br>
	The running game here will be the key for the Elephants of Alabama if they plan on winning this game.  With two top-25 ranked teams, this ought to be an exciting game.  Ever wondered why the heck Alabama has two home fields?  I was just thinking that the reasoning behind that was so that if they got spanked really bad at one they wouldn’t have to show up there again next week.  Well this is my sleeper game of the week.  Look for Southern to pull the upset by 3.<br>
            <b>Alabama 21 Southern Mississippi 24</b><br>
            <br>
            <b>Game # 2&nbsp;<br>
            Arkansas vs. Auburn</b><br>
	Well, being that this is the home state of Bill Clinton and practically nothing has ever come from Arkansas that has ever amounted to anything, I do not look for the Razorbacks to do much damage to the mighty A-Train.  Look for Ben Leard to make his return to the lineup this week and the Tigers to have the complete game together. This is the week that Auburn starts setting things straight in the SEC.  Auburn wins by 7.<br>
            <b>Arkansas 28 Auburn 35</b><br>
            <br>
            <b>Game # 3<br>
            Georgia vs. Florida</b><br>
	In what is known as the words largest Cock Tail party, this is perhaps the biggest game in the SEC this year.  Whoever wins this one, that team will win the SEC.  If Georgia can pull off the upset of the year, then they have a shot at winning the SEC.  But do not look for the Gators to just roll over.  The Gators have only been beaten twice at home in the SWAMP this decade.  So look for Georgia to just put up a good effort, and if they win, well, that is just an added bonus.  Gators win by 17.<br>
            <b>Georgia 18 Florida 35</b><br>
            <br>
            <b>Game # 4<br>
            LSU vs. Ole Miss</b><br>
	Welcome, ladies and gents, to the all-out grudge game of the week. Look for the Rebels to come into “Death Valley” and try to take a bite out of the Tigers team.  However, Booty will try and slice and dice the Rebel defense up and down the field.  If LSU can get the offensive scheme figured out, they have a good chance to win the ball game; if not, the Rebels will just run all over them.  Ole Miss wins by 10.<br>
            <b>LSU 14 Ole Miss 24</b><br>
            <br>
            <b>Game # 5<br>
            South Carolina vs. Tennessee</b><br>
	Welcome to the butt-spanking of the 90’s.  If for some god-awful reason the Game Cocks were to beat the Volunteers this weekend, it would be the biggest upset in NCAA history.  However, I feel that this is probably the safest bet that anyone can make: Tennessee beats the S@#$ out of South Carolina.  Lou Holtz of the Game Cocks really shouldn’t even bother with showing up to try and coach this game, instead he should just get a ticket, sit in the stands, and drink some beer with the fans.  Without a doubt, Tennessee wins.  By how many is the question. . . Hmmmmm, let us say by 42.<br>
            <b>Tennessee 51 South Carolina 9 (if they get lucky)</b><br>
            <br>
	For those of you keeping up with the schedules, the following teams have the week off: Kentucky, Mississippi State, and Vanderbilt.<br>
            <br>
