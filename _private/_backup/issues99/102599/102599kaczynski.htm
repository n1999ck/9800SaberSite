            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> 	(U-WIRE) ANN ARBOR, Mich.-  Letters of correspondence admirers and others had sent to Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski while in prison now belong to the University and will soon be added to a collection of other anarchist materials in the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">University spokesperson Joanne Nesbit said the collection of letters addressed to and from Kaczynski is being processed by staff in the University’s Special Collections Library.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The letters date from April 1996 to 1999 and when stacked together measure “four of five linear feet.”&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“It was known this was going to be a controversial issue,” University President Lee Bollinger said last night from his residence in Vermont, adding that he became aware of the acquisition about six months ago.<br>
            University spokesperson Julie Peterson said the material arrived at Special Collections several weeks ago.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Kaczynski was linked to 16 bomb attacks that occurred between 1978 and 1995, injuring 29 and killing three people.  He plead guilty to 13 federal charges in January 1998 and was sentenced to four life sentences in prison in May 1998.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Kaczynski’s materials are being added to the Labadie Collection area of Special Collections - one of the world’s most extensive collections of works of anarchism and social protest.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The letters and other correspondence are currently unavailable for public viewing but will be available once the collection has been processed by library staff. 	Processing the documents could take at least a year, Nesbit said.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Original documents will not be made available to the public. But photocopies of the letters with the names of correspondents blacked out to protect their identities will be available.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nesbit said the collection is primarily composed of correspondence sent to Kaczynski, but included in the donation are carbon copies of materials Kaczynski wrote.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Material admitted as evidence in Kaczynski’s trail case will not be available until “he has exhausted his appeals options,” Nesbit said. She explained the University plans to request the remaining portion of Kaczynski’s materials.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Judy Clarke, one of Kaczynski’s defense attorneys, said yesterday from her office in Spokane, Wash., that she is not at liberty to discuss the acquisition.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> Bollinger said the acquisition of the materials is important to research despite the fact it may attract criticism.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The main question is whether this material is relevant to scholarly research and the answer is clearly yes,” Bollinger said.</font></td>
