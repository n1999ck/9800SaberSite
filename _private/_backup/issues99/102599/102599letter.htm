            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Do any of you remember when you were younger and in your middle school social studies classes and your teacher made you write a letter to your congressman (or congresswoman)? You never really wanted to do it, thought it was a waste of time. I mean, who’s going to listen to the voice of some twelve year old who hasn’t even reached puberty
            yet?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	And then you went to high school. Those years that are lost in the memories of best friends, boyfriends, girlfriends, secret notes, and secret crushes. And perhaps there you had one of those teachers who was into a cause; Green Peace, curing hunger, saving the whales, something that she always tried to get the whole class involved in. Another set of mundane letters sent to some faceless person who you knew would never read what you wrote nor care what you thought. After all, those Friday nights roaming the mall were much more important, weren’t they?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And then came college and a campus that was full of activities, people, and, of course, causes. But more importantly, when you entered college you began to see that perhaps those letters you wrote did have some impact, or at least would have some if you wrote them now. And you begin to realize that with that newfound freedom comes a newfound voice. Now what do you do with it?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Are some of you wondering where I’m going with this? Well, now that I’m done waltzing down memory lane I’ll get to my point. Each of you on this campus has a voice in what goes on. True, you may voice your opinion and nothing may get done, but at least people will know that you are noticing the activities that occur here and that some people are actually being affected by them.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	But as much as you do have a voice, you also must realize that who you talk to matters quite a lot. If you have a problem with the attendance policy, I wouldn’t exactly go complaining to the Vice President of Finance. Likewise, if you have a problem with Student Government, I wouldn’t hunt down members of the Greek Council to complain.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> 	If you have a problem take it to the source. For example, if someone has a comment or critique of the Saber, come by the office, speak to someone, send an email, call, write a letter to the editor. Most organizations function the same way. Short of standing in the middle of the cafeteria and harassing every person who comes through asking for input on their specific organization, people try to make it as easy as possible for students to comment.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	So if you have something to say, come out to the source and say it. Put a face with a problem. Don’t hide behind someone else and expect them to take care of things for you. Your mama’s not here. Don’t hide behind her skirt anymore.
