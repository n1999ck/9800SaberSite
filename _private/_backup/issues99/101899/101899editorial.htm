            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	A year ago last week a twenty one- year old student in Wyoming was kidnapped, beaten, and left hanging on a fence to die. And die he did, to the horror and disbelief of a country in which many would have turned their heads rather than hear about another killing.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	But this was no ordinary death, nor was it an ordinary person. Matthew Shepard, a student at the University of Wyoming, Laramie, had just begun his studies in international politics, hoping to fight for human rights. One night while nursing a drink at a local bar, two men sidled up to him and asked if he wanted to go out on the town with them. When Shepard admitted to the two that he was gay, they took what little money he had, pistol whipped him until his skull was crushed, and hung his limp body crucifix style on a fence outside the town.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	This week the jury selection continues in the trial of the men accused of killing Shepard. This, coupled with the anniversary of his death, and the celebration of National Coming Out Day has brought national attention to gay rights and the acceptance of those who lead what some call an ‘alternative’ lifestyle.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The term tolerance has been used lately in conjunction with discussion of homosexual people and the lifestyle they lead. Tolerance has been the politically correct term used by many, but it seems to have become outdated. It seems that now the word that needs to be used is acceptance.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Accepting people for who they are is something some are taught from a young age. Just because this person is from a different part of town or doesn’t have the same type of fancy clothes hasn’t made much of a difference in the past decade. People have become accepting of others no matter what socio-economic background they may be from.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	So how is a person’s sexual orientation any different? It’s not a matter of toleration any more, it’s accepting people for who they are. Sexuality should no longer be a consideration. Some of the most interesting, caring, and intelligent people I have ever met have been gay. I didn’t tolerate the fact that they were gay, I accepted it, and because of that I learned more about them than a solely tolerable person would have.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Toleration is a word that should be stricken from the dictionary, removed from a child’s vocabulary; simply put, it should be removed as acceptable in society. Children should be raised to accept everyone, no matter what race, religion, or sexual orientation. If that happened, in a few generations we may have a society that doesn’t see race, gender, or sexuality as something to tolerate, but as something that creates each individual.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Albert Einstein once said, “Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.” Mathew Shepard was a great spirit, and died because two of the world’s mediocre could not leave their sheltered, narrow-minded worlds to see what spirits are truly made of. Shepard’s spirit and memory shall live on as a reminder that, although we may be a world of innovation, we are still a society that divides itself into the ‘average’ and the ‘closet goers.’ That old saying, “united we stand, divided we fall” comes to mind. Perhaps in the next millenium we can become as one, a nation united. And perhaps some people will finally come out of their closets and learn acceptance.</font></td>
