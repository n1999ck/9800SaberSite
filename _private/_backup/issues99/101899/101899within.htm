            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I’m tired of being misrepresented and misconceived as a Christian.  Just because I am a Christian does not mean that I hate homosexuals, evolutionists, Teletubbies, and Mickey Mouse.  My moral and religious beliefs don’t necessarily mean that I am narrow-minded and  ignorant, either.  And furthermore, you’re not going to catch me standing on a bench calling people names and yelling a modern rendition of  “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God.”  Can you tell that I’m slightly perturbed?  I hope so.  I’d like to take a little time to explain exactly who I am and how I view some issues as a Christian.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I was raised in a Christian household, but I haven’t followed blindly in the footsteps of my Southern Baptist parents.  I spent my sophomore and junior year in college figuring out exactly why I believe what I do.  I studied evolution, checked out the tenets of other religions, read parts of the Koran, the Tao Te Ching, some Hindu literature, and some secular philosophy.  I also read what some Christian intellectuals, like T.S. Eliot and C.S. Lewis, wrote about their reasons for becoming Christians.  Over and over again, Christianity was the only truly transcendent way of life that I found.  I guess other things might make other people happy, but Christianity is my choice.  I don’t want to preach, but I would like to clarify what I mean by “Christianity,” because there is a lot of weird stuff out there that bears the Christian label.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	To me, Christianity is pretty simple:  It involves believing in Jesus Christ in a very personal way and trying to live up to the standards He set for us in the Bible.  Granted, theology isn’t quite that easy, but if you get the Jesus part right, the rest follows.  Christianity is a lot more than organized religion, and ideally, it transcends denominations and ethnic groups.  As a Christian, I try to live up to high moral standards (note the word try), and I try to show everyone, from other Christians to homosexuals to atheists, the love that God has shown me.  That’s my religious conviction in a nutshell, so let’s get on to my other topics:  tolerance, homosexuals, and
            Teletubbies.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I think that the movement toward tolerance in our society has made people with strong moral or religious beliefs into bad guys.  If a person thinks that homosexuality is a sin, that person is automatically viewed as self-righteous, intolerant, and who knows what else.  Personally, I believe that the Bible says clearly that homosexuality is unnatural, and therefore, I believe that it is.  But that does not mean that I hate homosexuals or that I am homophobic.  Homosexuals are people just like the rest of us, and it is God’s job to judge them, not mine.  I’m sure my list of past mistakes is as long as most people’s, so I’m not the one to start throwing stones.  As a Christian, I am supposed to love my neighbor, no matter what his/her sexual preferences are, but that doesn’t mean I have to condone homosexual activity.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I do think that there are Christians out there who take their convictions too far.  Example:  the whole “Tinky-Winky is gay” controversy.  I watched the Teletubbies once just to see what all the fuss was about, and I thought it was a harmless, if annoying, television show for toddlers.  Those things on the tops of the Teletubbies’ heads are awfully phallic and yonic, but you can draw your own conclusions from that (paging Dr. Freud, Dr. Sigmund Freud).  Here is my Tubby Theory:  Tinky-Winky isn’t gay; he’s a she — or at least that’s what I gathered from the triangle on its head.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I think that tolerance is wonderful, as long as it extends to all people and as long as it is practiced intelligently.  I’m not a proponent of narrow-mindedness, but I would rather be a little narrow-minded than to be so open-minded that all my brains leak out.  If we are going to be a tolerant society, there should be as much tolerance for the belief that homosexuality is wrong as there is for the belief that it is not.  If that isn’t the case, we are simply shifting from one form of intolerance to another, and that doesn’t seem like progress to me.  Maybe the best way for us to reconcile our differences would be to follow some advice about judging others that a teacher gave me several years ago.  He always said, “Sweep off your own doorstep before you try to clean up someone else’s.”  I think that would keep us all busy for awhile.</font></td>
