            <hr noshade size="1" color="#3D117B">
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Have you ever had one of those days when a series of inconsequential, yet annoying circumstances culminates into a small nervous breakdown by 10 p.m.?  Yesterday was one of those days for me.  I had a novel to read, an oral report due in two days, a paper to work on, and a column to write and not nearly enough time to do all that and have time left for a few basic necessities . . . like eating or sleeping, for instance.  I had absolutely no idea what to write a column about, and I hadn’t even started preparing my report.  But none of this bothered me!  None of this drove me near tears or plunged me into emotional chaos!  In the midst of this stress (which I was handling very well, by the way) I dropped my novel for a moment to go use the bathroom.  A short time later, I returned to the bathroom to find the source of my psychosis: My toilet hadn’t flushed!  What I had left there was still there, and it stayed there no matter how many times I jiggled the handle and watched the water spin ineffectually down into the porcelain abyss, taking nothing but the last of my sanity with it.</font>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This was the proverbial straw.  This was the stupid, ludicrous event that left me sitting on my balcony, frozen in a state of emotional distress.  But, before you think I am a total basket case, you must understand that this was only the most recent event in the Epic Saga of Leslie’s Toilet (volumes 1 and 2 now available in paperback). You see, this problem has a history.&nbsp;</font>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The first weekend after I moved into Courtyard II, my toilet stopped flushing.  This problem obviously needed more than a simple plunger job.  I waited until Monday morning and then put in a work order.  Monday came and went.  Tuesday came and went.  Meanwhile, I’m still running back and forth to my roommates’ potty.  Wednesday came along with the maintenance men.  They walked into my apartment and looked into my toilet.  “Yep, it’s broken,” they said.  (I had known this for some time.)  Then, they left!  The next day, they came back.  They looked at my toilet again, as if to say, “Yep, it’s still broken.”  (It sure hadn’t fixed itself.)  Then, to my growing frustration, they left again!&nbsp;<br>
	Needless to say, by Friday morning I was a trifle irritated.  I went down to the Residence Life Office and said very nicely, “Look.  Someone needs to come fix my toilet.  Now.”  I really did say it nicely, but the vein that was probably bulging out of my forehead warned them, I guess.  When I returned to my apartment a few hours later, the maintenance man was standing outside the building.  He took one look at me and said “I’m going up there right now.”  I think someone had warned him.  The whole time he was working in my apartment, he talked to me like I was a bomb just waiting to explode.  I wanted to say, “Look.  I’m not going to yell at you.  Just fix my toilet!”  Well, he fixed my toilet and life returned to normal.  No more emergency
            I-drank-too-much-water-before- bed trips to my roommates’ bathroom at three in the morning.&nbsp;</font>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	So now you know why this most recent commode crisis was the one thing that made me temporarily nuts last night.  The one good result of this experience, I suppose, was that I finally had something to write a column about.  So, I hope you have enjoyed this silly edition of “Within a (Bath) Room Somewhere.”  Now, will someone please come fix my toilet?!
