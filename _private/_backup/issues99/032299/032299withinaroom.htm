        <p><font size="3">By the time this column is printed, Spring Break memories will already
        be jumbled in our minds with tests, projects, and the million and one factoids that we
        have the pleasure of absorbing in college. I hope that all of you had a vacation as
        enjoyable as mine. Early Saturday morning, I left college and Columbus behind and headed
        for inner-city Houston, TX, with seven other members of the BSU. We climbed into the van
        without knowing exactly what to expect for the week, and 14 hours later, we arrived at
        Gano Mission Center, in the &#147;bad part&#148; of Houston&#146;s Northside. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">We spent Sunday getting acclimated to our surroundings and buying
        supplies for the week. Then, on Monday, we got our first job assignments. Some of the guys
        were immediately put to work digging a ditch to bury some telephone cable in the parking
        lot. They also had to find the locations of an underground pipe. Fortunately, they found
        the pipe, but unfortunately, they broke it in the process. Then they had to dig some more
        in order to fix the pipe. (And you&#146;re thinking, &#147;What a great way to spend
        spring break&#148;). </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">The girls, including myself, got put to work disassembling and moving
        bunk-beds, then painting a large dining hall. I think the wall painted one girl as much as
        she painted it. In any case, she was quite blue by the end of the day. We spent our nights
        relaxing, playing games, and doing Bible studies. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">But all of these activities were only part of the reason we went to
        Houston. We also had a chance to help people of all ages in the poverty-stricken inner
        city. On one day, we played with children in an after-school program, and one night
        participated in a teen club that is designed to keep teenagers off the rough city streets.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Out of all the programs we helped with, the food pantry and the senior
        adult luncheon were my favorites. For both of these ministries, the people receiving food
        have to be interviewed each time they come. The neighborhood around Gano is primarily
        Hispanic, and most of the adults who come to the mission speak only Spanish. This gave two
        of the other group members and myself a chance to practice our fledgling Spanish skills. I
        interviewed people for two days, getting financial information and finding out what they
        wanted from the available food list. My Spanish was okay, but I never found anyone who
        knew a translation for &#147;grits.&#148; I talked to one homeless man who lifted my
        spirits much more than I lifted his, and talking with the senior adults was wonderful.
        They were all so amazed that we had given up our vacation to work at Gano.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">By the time we got back to Columbus, we were all exhausted, but glad
        that we had made the trip. I decided to write my column about our trip to remind everyone
        how great it can be help others. We might have worked during our vacation, but it was
        worth it to know that we helped a lot of people who depend on the mission centers for
        food, clothing, and spiritual needs. So next time you have the opportunity to help
        someone, whether it is for a week, a day, or for five minutes, do it. You won&#146;t be
        disappointed. The world needs a little more selfless kindness these days. </font></td>
