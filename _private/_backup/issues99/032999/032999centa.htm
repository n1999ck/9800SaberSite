        </table>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">For many, Dr. Centa was a teacher in the true sense of the
        word. Dr. Centa&#146;s family, many of his friends, colleagues, students and former
        students took part in a memorial service, &#147;A Time for Remembrance&#148;, held in his
        honor Thursday night.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One by one, people walked, some crying, to the podium and
        told stories about what Dr. Centa meant to them. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Many of the stories were funny, some were touching and
        others profound. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One professor told the story of how, while visiting India,
        Dr. Centa was treated for a stomachache by a shaman. It was after the fact that Dr. Centa
        realized that part of the shaman&#146;s ritual included marijuana smoke. Dr. Centa spent
        much of his last hours in India preparing for the plane trip home by attempting to wash
        the smoke from his clothing. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Several students and former students told of how much Dr.
        Centa meant to them and how often he went the extra mile. Students talked about a chair in
        his office, which was always available for students to sit in and just talk. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Centa was portrayed as a very sensitive and thoughtful
        man. One student told of Dr. Centa&#146;s attempt to convince her to adopt the lab rats at
        the end of experiments. She also said that every time she sees a bow tie she will fondly
        remember Dr. Centa, whose signature accessory was colorful bow ties. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Another student said Dr. Centa was the most challenging
        teacher she had ever had. He expected the best out of his students and his classes were
        tough and demanding, according to many students. Students said Dr. Centa challenged them
        to think, analyze, and criticize. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Two colleagues of Dr. Centa&#146;s for over 20 years, Dr.
        Mary Schild and Jeanne Dugas, spoke at the memorial, saying that his shoes could never be
        filled. Dr. Schild spoke of Dr. Centa&#146;s longtime dedication to the school and his
        students. Dr. Dugas remembered sharing recipes and gardening tips with Dr. Centa. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">His former wife, Jeanne Centa and their daughter, Michelle,
        were present and spoke with others at the memorial. Dr. Frank Brown, President of the
        University also attended and spoke. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Centa was, at times, a controversial figure, who kept
        students thinking and talking.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Many of his philosophies, particularly, the fact that he
        was very outspoken about his atheism, upset some people and gave others pause to consider
        his point of view. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">He once said that a most important task was to attempt to
        encourage others to open up their minds to possibilities other than beliefs that have been
        indoctrinated in them. He did this amid criticism, ridicule and mockery, but he held fast
        to his convictions.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Centa had been with the university since 1970. He
        taught introductory psychology classes and several upper level psychology classes such as
        Pseudopsychology and the Paranormal, Sensations and Perceptions, Physiological Psychology,
        Behavioral Studies, Learning Cognitive Psychology, and Comparative Psychology. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Centa specialized in neurological functioning and
        behavior. He also believed in the value of critical thinking and taught students how to
        look at things from a logical point of view. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">He graduated in 1967 from Kent State University in Ohio and
        received his Master&#146;s degree and Doctorate from Auburn University. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Centa was a volunteer assistant fire chief and was
        recently accepted to go to Russia on a Fulbright grant. He was twice nominated for
        Educator of the Year.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Centa traveled extensively. He visited England on a CSU
        grant and traveled to Mexico four times between 1987 and 1995. He visited his daughter in
        Japan in 1993, spent 100 days in India on a Fulbright Visiting Professorship grant in 1995
        and spent 10 days in the Amazon rain forest of Peru in 1998.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Centa will be missed by many on campus and elsewhere.
        Dr. Dugas read a poem, Funeral Blues, at the memorial service. She said, &#147;It says a
        lot that he liked this poem.&#148; A copy of the poem, by W.H. Auden, follows this story. </font></p>
