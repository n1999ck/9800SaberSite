	As I was searching for a topic this week, one of my friends complained to me that every time she is with a group of women, the subject always turns to body weight and dieting.&nbsp;</font>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	She suggested that I write a column about this “weight obsession,” and with that in the back of my mind, I went to my walking class later that afternoon.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	You would never guess what topic of conversation popped up while I walked around the soccer field with two other female students:  Dieting.  So, I took that as a sign that I needed to address this subject in my column.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Actually, though, this is a topic that has bugged me for quite some time.  I’m not in perfect shape; I’m almost ten pounds over my ideal body weight.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	But I am healthy and happy with myself.  I would rather maintain my present body weight than go on a diet that would make me miserable and possibly damage my health.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Granted, I don’t have highest fitness standards in the world.  As a victim of asthma, I’m happy if I have the energy and strength do everything I want to do and still breathe when it’s over.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I have friends who are in better shape than I am, yet they constantly obsess about their weight.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Back at home, I have one friend who is in good shape and has a perfectly proportioned figure, but every time we go out, she says, “My butt is so big.  Does this outfit make it look bigger?”&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	It drives me absolutely crazy!  We need to learn to be happy with our bodies, because no matter how much we diet, we will still have some little imperfection to make us unhappy.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	On a more serious note, our cultural obsession with weight often has devastating results.  Over the past five to ten years, anorexia and bulimia have become household words.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I decided to do a little research on eating disorders, and some of the things that I found were quite chilling.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Under the heading “Eating Disorders,” on Lycos’ WebMD, I found the following causes for anorexia and bulimia.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	These social factors ranked higher on the list of causes than genetics or clinical depression.  Here they are:<br>
            <br>
            Family Pressures:  “Negative factors within the family, possibly both inherited and environmental, play a major role in triggering and perpetuating eating disorders. One study found that 40% of 9 to 10 year-old girls try to lose weight, generally with the urging of their mothers . . . Although mothers may have a strong influence on their children with eating disorders, fathers and brothers who are overly critical may also play a role in the development of anorexia in girls.”&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Cultural Pressures:  “The social pressures of Western culture certainly play a major role in triggering eating disorders. Advertisers heavily market weight-reduction programs and present anorexic young models as the paradigm of sexual desirability . . . Clothes are designed and displayed for thin bodies in spite of the fact that few women could wear them successfully. Although at highest risk are those whose entire sense of self is based on outside approval and physical appearance, few women are immune to these influences.”&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
	On a website titled “Eating Disorders in a Disordered Culture,” I found testimonies from people who have suffered or are still suffering from eating disorders.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I have selected some excerpts from these testimonies that confirm the causes listed above.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I thought I would share these because sometimes we don’t realize the impact that cultural pressures, attitudes, and even small comments can have on the people around us.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	For the full versions of these stories, see the website at http://eating.ucdavis.edu/.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Andrea’s Story:  “I was a chubby child growing up with a perfectly skinny twin sister. She seemed to receive all my parents and our peers’ attention because she was thin. I felt ignored which developed my shyness.  She dominated in almost everything that we did together.  I thought that going on a diet would increase my self-esteem and get people to notice me.”&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Heather’s Story:  “What angers me is the fact that I received many compliments from guys when I was anorexic. It was like they were supporting my problem. Couldn’t they realize that I was sick?!?”&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Jennifer’s Story:  “I placed an inordinate sense of power in physical appearance, which isn’t hard to do in this very visual culture.”&nbsp;<br>
            Geri’s Story:  “It all began as skipping one meal after being called a fat pig.”&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
	Some people do have serious weight problems, and they should try to lose weight to improve their health.  However, many of the people affected by eating disorders were never overweight, much less obese, in the first place.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	You don’t have to reach the extreme of anorexia or bulimia to have an eating disorder, either.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Any obsession with weight is classified as an eating disorder, and many popular diets can be extremely detrimental to a person’s health.&nbsp;<br>
	We need to make peace with our bodies, and if we diet, we should do it for ourselves, not because of what other people think of us.
