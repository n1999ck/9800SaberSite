<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Tau Kappa Epsilon posted flyers and banners around the campus last week advertising their annual Kamanawanalaya party. Sheet banners were hung up outside the Davidson Center and on the front of Howard Hall. Posters were also hung up throughout buildings on the campus.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The controversy stems from the scenes portrayed on the posters. The first set of posters that were displayed featured pictures of various women in bikinis and displayed the organization’s name and the location of the party. These posters were removed on Monday but were replaced with a scene of men and women, some in swimwear, with a man chasing a woman in the background and a man holding what appears to many to be an alcoholic beverage in the center of the picture.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Some females on campus have reacted to the ads saying that they portray a sexist attitude towards women. Many have also said that the ads may be encouraging things such as underage drinking and unprotected sex and could result, in an extreme case, in date rape becoming an occurrence at parties such as this that are advertised on campus.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Columbus State University student handbook states, under the section on Student Responsibilities, that “lewd, indecent, and obscene conduct and/or expression are prohibited.”  Dr. Terry Norris, Director of Judicial Affairs, stated that the handbook was not specific and was “open to interpretation.”&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A spokesperson from the Tau Kappa Epsilon National office, when told about the first posting of women in scantily clad clothing, stated that the members of the fraternity “could have used better judgement” in their advertising for this particular party.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Female faculty and staff were asked about their opinion on the advertisements. Reactions were mixed, with some saying that the posters may seem offensive to some but that it did not affect them in that manner. Others were more vocal in their opposition to the campaign.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Cathy Fussell, Coordinator of the Writing Lab stated that “if [she] was a female student on this campus, [she’d] have nothing to do with TKE as long as they exhibit this sort of immaturity.” She also stated that the members of TKE may want to “visit another campus to get some fresh ideas.”&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ann Rosenthal, Assistant Professor of Communications, stated that they teach their
students “communicative competence,” which “entails a sensitivity to the members of an audience (community).” She said that she was “disappointed” that students did not seem to be relating this competence in this case.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When the TKE house on campus was called in regards to the questions that have arisen they stated that the party was “traditional” for their chapter and that they were “looking forward to people joining them.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Omicron Tau chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon was founded at Columbus College on January 22, 1977 and now numbers over 250. The chapter is involved in many fund raising and philanthropic organizations including the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation and the Special Olympics.</font></p>

Career Center<br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><img border="0" src="../../../issues99/090799/images/090799sheeks.jpg" align="left" width="150" height="184">	Did you know that there is a place on campus where you can participate in a cooperative education program, making money while gaining experience in the business world?  While you’re there, you can also design your resume, have it critiqued, then tailor it to fit the job you’re looking for.  While you’re at it, employees will be glad to give you information on the volunteer programs available in Columbus.  Are you curious yet?  Well, if you are, feel free to stop by the Career Center, located in the Davidson Center by the bookstore.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to Acting Director of the Career Center, Gina Sheeks, employment opportunities from the Columbus region come in every day.  “We certainly want our students to take advantage of the services offered. Our graduates are very fortunate right now; they’re going into a stable economy, unemployment is low, and many job opportunities are available to them.”  Recruiters have told Sheeks, however, that they will leave a position open rather than fill it with someone unprepared for the job.  In a world in which college graduates are becoming more and more common, employers are looking at much more than a student’s GPA.  Extracurricular activities, community service, and previous job experience are often the deciding factors in who gets a position.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Aside from offering the aforementioned services, as well as many more, to college students, the CSU Career Center provides the same services to its alumni.  “Most people change jobs at various points of their lives, and the Career Center is available to them during these transition periods.”  CSU is striving to “network more closely to the alumni in the area.”  Students can talk to alumni about their future careers, and spend time with the graduates who already have jobs.  “It’s a mentoring program,” says
Sheeks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Lesa Kerlin, the former director of the Career Center, accepted a job offer from Truman University in Missouri as the school’s Director of Career Services.   “It was a very positive move for her,” says Sheeks, who is now acting director of the CSU Career Center.  Sheeks is “very excited” about her new job.  Before accepting the position, which she has occupied since August 16, Sheeks was an assistant professor of communication at CSU, a job she has held since 1992.  She received an undergraduate degree in journalism, with an emphasis on public relations from Murray State University and a master’s degree in organizational communication. At present, she is a doctoral candidate in Educational Policy Studies, with emphasis in higher education, at Georgia State University.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As acting director of the Career Center, Sheeks’ duties include supervising the services offered, working with individual students who are preparing for the job market, and speaking to classes to encourage the students to start job-search preparation early rather than waiting until their senior year.  “One goal I have is to try to bridge academic life with the student services division, because both are critical to our students’ success-the two areas should complement each other.”<br>
	Sheeks is enjoying her new position because, “in communication classes, I am equipping students with skills they’ll be able to use throughout their lifetimes.  [Working at the Career Center,] I hope to further enhance those skills by assisting students in preparation with their careers.”<br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Grab your bike, grab your kids, set the alarm clock, and come on out to the Bicycle Safety Rodeo, to be held Saturday, September 25 right here on the CSU campus (follow the signs). The event is free, and all participants will also receive a free bicycle helmet.  Pre-registration is required to insure helmets are available for all, so use the form printed here, or get one at the Public Safety Office in Davidson Center.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The event is sponsored by the Pilot Club of Columbus in conjunction with the Columbus Police Department, the CSU Department of Public Safety and the Columbus Health Department. The 9 a.m. rodeo will feature numerous exciting events.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">After sign-in at the entrance, participants will view a bike safety video hosted by the Health Department Environmental Services Division. This will be followed by a stop at the helmet-fitting area to insure each free helmet is properly sized to the rider. The next stop will be a “Bike Shop” where all bicycles will be thoroughly inspected and necessary repairs will be made or suggested. Then the fun begins: a “Crazy Crossroads” obstacle course will challenge riders to negotiate a variety of traffic situations, including safe stopping, left and right turns, and other simulations based upon on-street riding. The slalom course will require delicate maneuvering between the zig-zag cones and, upon completion of these courses,  a final, “secret” obstacle course will lead the riders to the end of the event area.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Every rider completing the course will receive a free “goodie bag” which will contain certificates for McDonalds, games, and other prizes. While the rodeo is open to all ages, children must have a parent or guardian sign the release form, which is part of the registration.</font></p>

visits campus<br>

src="../../../issues99/090799/images/090799barr.jpg" align="left" width="217" height="263">Republican Congressman Bob Barr visited the CSU campus last Monday to answer questions and raise awareness about his upcoming re-election campaign.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Barr spoke in the Fine Arts Hall Auditorium to a small group of republican supporters from the surrounding area. The speech included a moderated question and answer period in which Barr spoke about some of the problems that he sees facing the Congress and the American people in the next millennium.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	In an interview before the speech the Congressman answered questions in reference to his recent stance on religious practices on military bases. In response to the military allowing enlisted personnel to practice Wicca on bases, Barr said that it was “absolute nonsense to allow the practice of witchcraft on military bases.” This supports an earlier comment he made this year in which he stated that allowing this practice to continue would set a “dangerous precedent that could easily result in the practice of all sorts of bizarre practices being supported by the military under the rubric of religion.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Barr also spoke to the audience about what he thought America’s weaknesses were going into the next century which include the continuing decline in the strength of the military and the fall of the country’s morality. He said that he thought the United States military was “not equipped to handle problems.” Barr also spoke about Y2K problems, stating that he was worried about the way the present administration was dealing with problems, but was glad that the Congress forced the issue of compliance.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Barr is the representative for the seventh district of Georgia, which covers LaGrange, Carollton, Rome, and part of Marietta. He is an assistant majority whip and serves on a multitude of House committees including the House Judiciary Committee. Barr is a life member of the National Rifle Association and serves on its board of directors. He has also been awarded a number of awards during his term including the Friend of the Family award from the Christian Coalition.</font></p>
