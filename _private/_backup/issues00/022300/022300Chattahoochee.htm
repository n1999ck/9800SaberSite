                CSU PROFESSOR SPEAKS AT&nbsp;<br>
                COLUMBUS MUSEUM</b><br>
                <br>
	On Thursday, February 10, CSU’s own Dr. John S. Lupold presented a lecture on the influence of European contact on Native Americans in the Chattahoochee River Valley.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	Dr. Lupold gave his presentation at the Columbus Museum as part of an annual “Lunch and Lecture” series.  The “Lunch and Lecture” series is held every Thursday for the month of February. Each lecture runs from 12:15 to 12:50 pm.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	Guest speakers are invited to lecture on subjects pertaining to an exhibit in the museum.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	This year’s topic is “the contributions of Native Americans to the cultural heritage of the Chattahoochee River Valley.”&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	The presentations are centered around the new exhibit, “After The Trail of Tears.”</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	Before each lecture, lunch can be purchased at Place for Taste Cafe in the Columbus Museum, which is catered by Miriam’s cafe and Gallery.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	Thursday, February 17, Addie George, a Yuchi educator from Sapulpa, Oklahoma gave a lecture on Yuchi arts, crafts and language.&nbsp;<br>
	Tomorrow, Thursday, February 24, is the final lunch and lecture.  Billy Winn, the editorial page editor for the Columbus Ledger Enquirer and author of The Old Beloved Path: Daily Life Among the Indians of the Chattahoochee River Valley and  Building on a Legacy, will provide a presentation.  Winn will be discussing local Native American life in relation to their natural environment.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	Dr. Lupold’s lecture centered around capitalism as the greatest European influence on Native Americans.  Lupold sated that “the Spanish brought disease and Catholicism.” He also noted  that they brought with them war.  But of all the effects of European contact, Lupold says that  capitalism was the most profound.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	According to Dr. Lupold, Indians shifted from a subsistence living--killing and growing what they needed to live--to killing immense numbers of deer to sell their hides to the English and Spanish.&nbsp;<br>
	The deer that were killed for their hides provided far more meat than the tribes could ever use.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	Lupold says of the Creek Indians, “They learned to play the European diplomacy game.”&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	The Creeks came to be a powerful nation of Native Americans by trading and bartering with the Spanish.  Dr. Lupold says that when Andrew Jackson drove out the Spanish, the Creeks declined in power.<br>
	Why did the Creeks decline in power?  Because their source of powder, ammunition and other goods, was no longer available.  Their leverage in trading gave the Creeks their power.<br>
                <br>
                <b>PART TWO:<br>
                YUCHI INDIAN SPEAKS</b><br>
                <br>
	On Thursday, February 17, Addie George, a Yuchi Indian spoke at the Columbus Museum.  She spoke on and displayed Native American crafts.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	Addie George gave her presentation at the Columbus Museum as part of an annual “Lunch and Lecture” series.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	This past Thursday, Addie George told some fascinating stories of the Yuchi and their way of living.  From 1835 to 1838, 16,000 Cherokee, Creek and Yuchi Indians were exiled from their eastern homelands to live in Oklahoma.  Addie George recounted her great grandmother’s story of the Trail of Tears.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	Addie’s great grandmother, along with many other Yuchi Indians, stood on the banks of the Mississippi River.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	How would they make it across?&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	Addie’s great great uncle tied Addie’s great great grandmother (then a small child) onto his back and swam across the river.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	Needless to say, he made it.  Unfortunately, many did not.  Of the over 16,000 Native Americans that began the long journey, approximately four thousand died within the first year of the removal of the Eastern Indians from their homelands.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	Addie recounts her great great grandmother’s passing away by saying, “She wasn’t sick or nothin’.  She was just tired. So she just asked her daughter to make up her bed and to fix up her pillow good and she laid down and took a nap.”&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	She never woke up from the nap.  Addie’s great great grand mother died at the age of 110.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	Addie George told the audience of her efforts to preserve the Yuchi Language.  When she was a girl, Addie could not speak a word of English.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	She did not learn English until she was sent to boarding school where she was punished if she spoke Yuchi.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	Now, in the year 2000, there are few speakers of Addie’s native tongue.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	In fact, once when she had a meeting of Yuchi speakers in her home, she realized that every person in the world that spoke Yuchi was sitting there in her living room.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	Addie has collaborated with a linguist to produce a Yuchi alphabet and dictionary.<br>
                <br>
                Addie also spoke on Yuchi techniques of gathering and cooking food.  Much of the Yuchi diet consisted of wild fruits and vegetables.  The Yuchi also grew large fields of corn.  “Any way you can make corn, I’ll eat it,” proclaimed
                Addie.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	Addie George also displayed Yuchi crafts, some she made and others she purchased or were given to her.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	The crafts included both pottery and woven baskets and containers.  The woven baskets and containers were made of long-stem pine needles.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	The pine needles are made into small bundles and tied together with raphia, a kind of grass.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	To get a better idea of how the Chattahoochee River Valley Indians lived, come to some of the lunch and lectures at the Columbus Museum.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	Admission to the lectures is free as is admission to the museum itself.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	You may also want to check out Columbus Museum’s exhibits pertaining the Chattahoochee River Valley.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	Take a walk through time as you view artifacts and recreations of villages and homes from pre-history to modern day Georgia.<br>
	At the very end of the display is the “After the Trail of Tears” exhibit.  Some of the artifacts once belonged to Chief Sopathla, whose uncle had been on the Trail of Tears.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	The display features artifacts and pictures that tell us something of Native American ceremonial life, recreational activities and there cultural identity.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	At the “After the Trail of Tears” display you will find out that the Yuchi called themselves, “Tcho-ya-ha,” or “Children of the Sun,” and that they liked to play a game that is very much like soccer.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	So come to the Columbus museum, have a good time and learn about our local history.<br>
