                <font size="1">Jessica </font><font size="1">Trenchik / Features
                Editor</font></p>
				
                <p><font size="2">This  week’s Campus Candid is the smart and talented Lisa Michel.  Lisa is a sophomore and English major here at
                CSU.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">	Before becoming an English major, Lisa was majoring in music.  She has been playing the viola since she was in the sixth grade.  Lisa’s first choice was to play the violin, but according to Lisa, “Since everyone was signing up for the violin they were trying to get people to change, and so they told me to play the viola because of my hand size.”</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">	When asked why she switched majors Lisa jokingly replies, “because I don’t want to die on the streets.”  The real reason, Lisa says, is because “I’ve always liked English and reading and stuff like that, and I know there’s a lot of stuff you can do with an English major.”<br>
	Although she’s no longer a music major, Lisa has continued to play the viola in the CSU orchestra.  She says her favorite piece of classical music is Schubert’s
                “Standchen.”</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">	Lisa’s musical experience also includes playing with MYSO, which stands for the Metropolitan Youth Symphony Orchestra.  Lisa auditioned for and played with MYSO in Chicago during her Senior year.  In fact, playing with MYSO is where Lisa met one of her roommates, Shannon Bassett, a sophomore and music education major here at
                CSU.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">	Besides music, Lisa also enjoys sports.  “I like to swim,” Lisa says.  “I swam all four years of high school.”  She also played softball.  “I started playing when I was seven and played until about tenth grade,” says Lisa.  Lisa was also in a bowling league for a year.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">	Lisa came to CSU from Stone Mountain, Georgia.  She says she chose CSU because she “heard that Columbus had a good music program.”  She decided to audition and was awarded a scholarship.&nbsp;<br>
	Lisa also adds that the dorms were another reason she chose CSU.  Now, however, Lisa is considering the possibility of transferring to UGA because of its highly reputable liberal arts program.  She is a little apprehensive though because, she jokingly says, “I heard that you get hit by buses at
                UGA.”</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">	Lisa loves dogs.  She has had her pet cocker spaniel, Lucky, for seven years now.  According to Lisa, “He’s my baby.”  Cocker spaniels are Lisa’s favorite breed, but she says she wants the next dog she gets to be a basset hound.  Lisa collects what she calls “dog stuff,” which includes everything from stuffed animals to cross-stitches.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">	On the weekends, Lisa says she mostly likes to just hang out with friends.  Lisa jokes that on the weekends she usually ends up “going home because I have to get food and I can’t afford to buy food.”  Besides getting food, Lisa also likes to spend time with her sister and her sister’s fiancée while she’s at home.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">	Being from the Atlanta area, Lisa is, of course, a Braves fan.  Lisa says, “Steve Avery was my favorite player.  I was so in love with him.”  This year, Lisa says, “For a short time John Rocker was my favorite player.”  For obvious reasons, Rocker lost his status as Lisa’s favorite Brave.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">	Friend’s is Lisa’s favorite television show.  Her favorite “friends” are Phoebe and Chandler.  Titanic is her favorite movie.  Live, Smashing Pumpkins, and Bush are Lisa’s favorite bands.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">	Her favorite food is prime rib, and so naturally her favorite place to go out to eat is the Outback Steakhouse.  Stephen King is Lisa’s favorite author.  She says The Talisman is her favorite Stephen King novel.<br>
	As for future goals, Lisa says she would like to one day get married and become a writer.</font>
