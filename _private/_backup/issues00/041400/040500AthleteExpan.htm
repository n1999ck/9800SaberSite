                </font>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Over the past few months we have been taking a serious look at the direction of Columbus State University’s athletic program in the near future.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	In typical higher education fashion, we formed a committee, representative of the CSU community, and asked that the committee provide advice and counsel to us on this important issue.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	The issue, as we framed it, had to do with the expansion of the number and types of sports we offer for students at Columbus State.&nbsp;<br>
	It was acknowledged by all of us that a dominant question in this study would be the role of football in our institution over the next several years, although we all recognize that the question is much broader and deeper than simply one of a single sport.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	Specifically, the committee was asked to provide information regarding the attitudes of members of the CSU community about the enhancement of athletics. They did an excellent job providing information to us on that topic.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	We said from the outset, and repeat again here for emphasis, that simply being in favor of expanding our athletic program at Columbus State would not be sufficient to make us act on that desire.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	We would also need to ascertain that sufficient private support could be found to fund the expansion and we would have to be satisfied in our own hearts that the time is right for CSU to expand, in certain areas, with specific sports.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	The information provided by the committee has been invaluable to us in reaching our decision. Through the use of a survey instrument, literally thousands of students, faculty and staff and alumni of CSU were polled to ascertain their opinions about expansion.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	The survey was very revealing and gave us some insights which, frankly, we had not been privy to previously.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	While there was a strong indication of support for beginning football (on the condition that it would be funded with private donations and would not be financed by raising student athletic fees) there was also very strong support for the expansion of other sports on our campus.<br>
	For example, for men’s sports, there was strong support for the addition of soccer, track and field, wrestling and swimming. For women, there was strong support for soccer, gymnastics, track and field, volleyball and swimming.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	Since football is such a dominant sport in our region of the country and since it generates such excitement, both positive and negative when it is discussed on a college campus, we want to deal with that issue first, before we begin to assess the feasibility of enhancing athletics in other directions. So let’s get right to the issue.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	It is perhaps no surprise that, when people were asked if they would support our adding football under the condition that it not cost them anything, there was widespread agreement with beginning the sport.&nbsp;<br>
	Of course, other factors must be considered before an institution would automatically start such an expensive and scholarship.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	It is our fear that the cost of a football program would cause us to shortchange the university in other areas, including private fundraising, which might otherwise serve academic purposes.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	We depend heavily on private funding for our partnership operations which relate to economic development and quality of life.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	For example, private funding has made possible partnerships such as the RiverCenter for the Performing Arts, the Coca-Cola Space Science Center and Oxbow Meadows.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	We cannot afford to have funds diverted from these mainstream functions of the university in order to fund an athletic program.<br>
	The disproportionate reallocation of athletic funds for football would be at the expense of other deserving sports on our campus, at a time when these established teams are experiencing regional and national success.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	One reason to begin football might be related to the growth of an institution. In our case, we had to ask ourselves “If football were to cause immediate growth in enroll ment, could we accommodate that growth in terms of classrooms, parking, student housing, food service and other infrastructure requirements?”&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	While CSU is showing many positive signs of growth, our ability to accommodate a surge of growth is several years off.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	One issue which has been referred to only tangentially in our discussions, but which has significant and dramatic influence on our decision, is that of the requirement for gender equity in intercollegiate sports at the collegiate level.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	Were we to begin football with the large number of male students involved in that sport, our gender equity status would be badly out of balance.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Even with the addition of several new women sports, we would be hardpressed to restore a semblance of balance in that crucial area. Obviously, the cost consideration goes far beyond funding football alone.  All the issues of scheduling - when and where games would be played, whether we would have a conference home for football, would be find a continuing support base for the program in Columbus and many, many other questions - were addressed and analyzed during our study.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	Our conclusion, therefore, is this: We believe that expansion of athletics at CSU is appropriate and should be considered for sports which could involve the largest number of students, at a reasonable cost to the institution, and in a manner in which we could preserve equitable treatment for potential male and female athletes.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	Therefore, we have concluded that football as a sport for Columbus State University would not be appropriate at this time in our institution’s development.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	We do not rule the sport out for the future but believe that we have some basic infrastructure issues to address. Those issues must be satisfactorily met before we could initiate, in good faith, a football program at Columbus State.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	Our next step will be to analyze all the opinions and information we have gathered to determine how expansion should be conducted and to seek community support for enhancing those programs.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">	This will be done through the normal administrative structure at Columbus State, with wide involvement of students, faculty and staff, alumni and friends of CSU as we seek to enhance athletics and thereby to enhance student life on our campus.</font>
