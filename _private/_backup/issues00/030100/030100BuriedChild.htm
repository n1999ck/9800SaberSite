                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Have you ever gone out of your way to do something nice for another person and been met with nothing but insults and rudeness? Or, better yet, have you ever attempted to carry out a responsibility and had to deal with unnecessary roadblocks on all sides? If you’ve ever been in either of these predicaments, you will appreciate what I have to say.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When I was assigned this article, it was intended to be a report of the recent production by the CSU theatre department of Buried Child. I was very excited, being a former thespian myself. I had never seen this play and knew that the director, Neal Fenter, was thrilled to bring it to the CSU theatre.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I was given my article assignment early and decided to try to get it in early to give the play added publicity while it was still being performed.  So opening night, I showed up with my roommate, my fiancé, and dozens of questions to ask the director. 	During the first intermission (it was a three act play), I got up to see if I could get some student reactions to the first part of the play. I saw the director standing around talking to a few people and so I went and introduced myself to him. I explained that I was writing an article for the Saber (he didn’t know what the Saber was) and that I would like to ask a few questions.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	His reply, including several eye rolls and huffs, was: “What!!! On opening night? No way. I don’t have time for stuff like that! If you want to talk to me, you can call and schedule an appointment to meet with me. No way!!! Nope!!!” He then walked over to a group of his buddies (a.k.a the only people laughing at the jokes in the play) and loudly stated that, “Some b**** asked me for an interview! Like, heeelllooo!! Can you believe it?!”. At that point I knew it would be a waste of time for me try to give a non-biased review of the play and left during the second intermission.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I’m not sure that Mr. Fenter is totally aware of this, but this is a college campus. The purpose for a campus is to create an atmosphere of scholarship and encouragement. When a professor reacts like a child when a student attempts to carry out a job and then belittles her efforts and calls her a derogatory name, all in about two minutes, that is pretty sad! Any professor who is trapped in his Ivory-Tower-delusions is a waste of a teaching position.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Just about every professor I have had at Columbus State has been exceptionally down to earth and has been willing to help students in anyway they can, even if they aren’t their own. There has been a real spirit of enthusiasm and zeal in just about all my classes. Mr. Fenter, however, reminds me of those few who have decided that the academic community would crumble with out them. Do these professors forget that at some point they too were clumsy pupils, and in fact still are? Or do they feel their obligations end once the spotlight is off of them?&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I feel awful for the cast of this play that I could not honestly give an objective write up. I feel that I could have given them a great deal of much needed publicity as well as an accurate critique. However, due to the man child performance I received during the intermission, the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth. It is important for students to realize when certain professors take away from their achievements. We forget that we are consumers and we just flock to where the professor leads us. When we encounter these people we owe it to ourselves to bring it to the attention of the powers that be.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	None of us here are professionals at what we want to do; why else would we be here? We are going to mess up, step on some toes, and try new things. And when we do, who do we want by our sides? Someone who is going to mock and insult you? Someone who is too busy talking to his circle of friends? Someone who has worked here for almost two decades yet doesn’t know what the campus newspaper is called? I didn’t think so!</font>
