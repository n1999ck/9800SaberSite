                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the end of this semester, one of the University’s most experienced music professors will be retiring.  Dr. Kruger, who has been teaching here at CSU for over thirty-four years, has decided to retire because "I'm going to be 71 years old and my wife (also a professor here) became tired too.  She's been teaching as long as I have."&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	He also states, "I like to teach young people, but I've gotten to the point were, gosh, I hate to be at a certain place at a certain time . . . I want to do what I want to do when I want to do it".&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	When he leaves this semester, he says that he will more than likely move to Atlanta to be with his children and grandchildren.  He states, "I grew up in Atlanta, it's my home.”  He also states, "My wife and I love to travel and hopefully we'll be doing alot of traveling, I'll see.  Maybe I'll write a book or something."</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	Dr. Kruger attended the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, where he graduated Magna Cum Laude.  He began teaching in Atlanta public schools in 1955 and taught for six years, while being the assistant director of the Atlanta Symphony.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	In 1961, he left his hometown to teach at Bowling Green University in Ohio and was the orchestra's conductor.  He then moved to Columbus in 1965 to be the conductor of the Columbus Symphony until 1987.&nbsp;<br>
	During this time, he also taught a two-thirds load at CSU.  After twenty-two years as the conductor of the Columbus Symphony he retired and began teaching here full-time.  After a few years, Dr Kruger began yearning to conduct again, so he formed the LaGrange Symphony, which he will still be conducting after his retirement at
                CSU.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	Dr. Kruger, began his music career in high school as a flutist.  He stated,&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
                "I wanted to be a great flutist, but I was also interested in conducting.   I don't know why . . . I was just inspired to go into conducting".&nbsp;<br>
	During his time at the New England Conservatory of Music, he visited&nbsp;<br>
                Tanglewood, a summer home for the Boston Symphony, and met Leonard
                Bernstein, who he described as, "the great conductor, a young conductor at the time".&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	When he graduated from the Conservatory, he had trouble with his lip and he felt that he could no longer be a great flutist.  He stated, "I felt so disillusioned, discouraged that I spent all this time, effort and money.  And here I couldn't play, so I said, the heck with music and went back to Atlanta and actually went into a luggage business.”&nbsp;<br>
                But soon he began to miss music, so he decided to teach and went back to the Conservatory to earn his master's in Music Education.  Dr. Kruger states, "I enjoying conveying to young people the richness and beauty of great music.  The Arts.  The importance of the Arts.”&nbsp;<br>
	He continues to say that, "The Arts are really culture.  The Arts are what really helps us understand ourselves better.  Understand our fellow human beings.  It tells us something about beauty, about truths, about meaning, about purpose."&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	He also feels that, "[The Arts make] human beings out of us."  He does not believe that enough young children in this country have enough exposure to great music and great art, which is something he feels humanizes us.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	He states, "Our attitude towards the Arts in this country is that Arts are nice.  It's nice for little Susie to study ballet, it gives her grace.  It's nice for Junior to play the piano, it'll give him some confidence.  The Arts are nice.  They are the icing on a cake.  They are a frill."&nbsp;<br>
	Kruger doesn't feel that "the Arts are nice”;  he states, "I don't think they are frill, but I think they are ABSOLUTELY essential . . . Music helps you in math, in history, even prenatal care."  		Krugerhas also been know to be pretty tough on his students.  He states that, "I want to try to give you [his students] one hundred percent in the classroom, and I expect the same from you.  You're going to give me one hundred percent in the class, and it's nothing personal."</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	And with those words, he will still miss his students the most when he retires.  He states, "I'll miss the participation of the students . . . I'll miss being with the students . . . I'll miss being with young people."<br>
	When Dr. Kruger leaves, he will not only take away with him his years of experience, but something he learned from his students.  He states that he learned, "not to prejudge so much.  Not to be so judgmental.  In other words, we do alot of stereotyping at all times."&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	He states, "I have big classes, fifty, seventy-five students and I look at a student and see maybe how they act out a little bit and I'll immediately form an impression.  I have found many times I’m totally wrong about the person  I thought was maybe difficult or it turns out that there is a reason for it.  Or I just judged them wrong, they turn out to be really nice."</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	Dr.  Kruger, everyone at CSU wishes you the best of luck on your retirement.  Enjoy it while it lasts, because as some of us know, you won't be able to sit around and do nothing for a very long time.</font>
