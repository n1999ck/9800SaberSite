                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I have been working as a tutor here at CSU for the past two years.  During that time, I have heard one lamentable phrase from way too many students.  “I hate reading,” they complain, and the very words make me cringe.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	I cannot imagine my life without reading.  As an English major, I read between 3,000 and 5,000 pages of material each semester, and that is just what I read for my classes.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	My fascination with reading started long before my college days, however.  Ever since my mom started reading to me when I was a child, I have read everything I could get my hands on, from fiction and poetry to food labels and signs.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	In fact, I read so much when I was a kid that I would get in trouble for reading too much.  Some kids got in trouble for playing too many video games or watching too much TV, but not me.  I often chose to read the next Nancy Drew mystery rather than do my homework, and when I was in class, my mind was usually off in an imaginary country.  You can imagine all the problems that caused.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	Well, I finally learned to balance my school work and my recreational reading by the time I got to high school.  Then, I went to college as an English major so that I could spend all of my time reading (believe me, that’s where most of my time goes, and I couldn’t think of many better ways to spend it).&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	Now I’m going to get on my soap box for a moment.  From my experience as a student and as a tutor, I have decided that the ability to read critically is one of the most important factors in academic success.  Reading helps people broaden their minds, think critically, and aquire knowledge and vocabulary.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	My reading skills help me out in my literature classes, but they also help in other courses, especially the sciences.  		Active reading promotes a type of mental discipline that can do more than help you read and understand a textbook.  Reading develops your imagination and teaches you to visualize concepts.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	There is a big difference between watching Mel Gibson play Hamlet and actually reading Hamlet.  Reading a book or play forces you to visualize characters, scenes, and actions, while watching television lets your imagination go into hibernation.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	Learning to visualize a character from your favorite novel can help you learn visualize complicated concepts from textbooks or lectures.&nbsp;<br>
	Many people who dislike reading learned to dislike it in high school, when they were forced to read things like Great Expectations or Julius Caesar.  (If that was all I had to read in 9th grade, I probably would have been traumatized, too.)&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	But you don’t have to read those kinds of books to benefit from reading.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	When I go home for vacation, do you think I read Shakespeare or Chaucer or James Joyce for fun?  Sometimes, but not too often.&nbsp;<br>
	To be honest, I’m a swords-and-sorcery fantasy junkie.  Give me a good David Eddings or Terry Brooks trilogy and you won’t see me for a week.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	Those books may not measure up to the “literariness” of Virginia Woolf or Joseph Conrad, but they still come with all the good side-effects of reading.  Do you know why I scored so well on the vocabulary section of the SAT?  It was because David Eddings loves to use words like “lugubrious” and “ostentatious” and “defenestrate.”&nbsp;<br>
	I really like that last one—it means “to throw someone out of a window.”&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	At any rate, my point is that reading actively can be both fun and beneficial.  This is my challenge to everyone out there who thinks reading is a chore:  If you don’t like literature, find a magazine or novel that you like (I don’t expect everyone to be a literature nerd like me ;o).&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	Even reading those horrid grocery store romances is better than reading nothing at all.  Next time you’re sitting in front of the TV, with your brain waves getting flatter and flatter and flatter, try reading.  It’s like power-lifting for your mind.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	Now, as I climb down from my soap box, I’ll leave you with one final thought from Alfred Stefferud.  In The Wonderful World of Books, he writes:&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	“Now, more than ever, a reminder is needed that books can instruct and help us in a competitive world, in which more and more knowledge is needed to keep up with scientific developments; that we need their advice on the problems and worries besetting us in education, in politics and foreign affairs, in domestic issues and economics, in agriculture, and in social matters; that they can provide fun and relaxation and inspiration in our distraught times; that in a world of television, radio, automobiles, of getting and spending and laying waste to our powers, books can give us perspective and depth and fulfillment.”</font>
