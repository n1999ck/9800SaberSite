                </font>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The CSU Music department hosted a wonderful program entitled Humor in Music at 7:00 p.m. April 6, 2000.&nbsp;
                The program was consisted of four multi-part instrumental pieces that were performed by CSU faculty and students.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	The featured works were: Lip My Reeds by Peter Schnickele, Aesop’s Fables narrated and set to music, Serenda for Three by Peter Schnickle and La Revue de Cuisine by Bohuslav Martinu.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	Each piece was performed by a combination of students and faculty.<br>
	The first piece, Lip My Reeds, was performed by four bassoonists.&nbsp;<br>
	These CSU students were Jennifer Brinson, Megan Green, Jessica Haynes and Heath Peters.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	The piece was a series of variations in notes of the music and sounds.&nbsp;<br>
	On occasion certain notes were exaggerated, making it a very light-heart performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Adding to the humor of the show was the choice of dress the bassoonists chose to wear.	Outfits ranged from an oversized tuxedo worn by Jessica Haynes to the Hawaiian-style shirt and denim short worn by Megan Green.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	The second piece, Aesop’s Fables, was narrated by William Bullock and accompanied by Kristen Hansen (french horn) and Janie Lee Bullock (piano).&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	The third piece featured was Serenade for Three and was performed by Edwin Riley (clarinet), Patricio Cobos (violin) and Kimberly Borom (piano).&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	This piece was divided into three parts.  The first part was a happy toned bouncy section, the second was a slow, peaceful section, and the final section was a very fast, at times almost country-like section.&nbsp;<br>
	All three parts were brilliantly performed by the three instrumentalists.  However, the very last section is what stood out so vividly.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	Mr. Patricio Cobos performed the fast-paced country/western characteristic of the piece well.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	The final piece, La Revue de Cuisine (The Kitchen Revue) was performed by a blend of instruments such as the trumpet (Richard Rulli), the cello (Ning Tien Scialla), the piano (Sue Ruby), the clarinet (Edwin Riley), and the bassoon (Ronald Wirt).&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	This piece again featured Patricio Cobos playing the violin.&nbsp;<br>
	The sections of this work ranged from solemn to the swing type music of the roaring 20s.  Again, it was performed very beautifully.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	The audience seemed to enjoy the experience of the concert.  Ellen Najjar, a studying musician at CSU, said “I thought it was very entertaining.  The students had a lot of fun with it.”&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	Ms. Najjar also stated, “I liked Aesop’s Fables the most because it was just really neat how the story, told by Dr. Bullock, went along with the music.”</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	Ms. Jessica Haynes, a featured bassoonist, said, “I liked the clarinet, violin and piano trio the most out of the whole concert because it was just so different.”&nbsp;
                </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Haynes has been studying music since the sixth grade.&nbsp;
                </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Along with other students, Haynes was asked to play in this concert after working on the piece in private.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	Megan Green, who was also featured in the first piece with Jessica Haynes expressed favor of Aesop’s Fables.&nbsp;
                She has been playing the bassoon for six years although she first started out playing the clarinet.&nbsp;
                Aside from school concerts she plays in New York every summer, in churches and different places in the Columbus community.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	The violinist of the concert, Patricio Cobos, expressed no certain favorite among the pieces performed.&nbsp;
                </font><font face="Arial" size="2">However, he did offer this statement, “It is very hard for someone like me to say who [my] favorite composer is or what [my] favorite piece was.	Usually, when you are playing that piece by that composer, in that moment, that is your favorite.”</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	Mr. Cobos has played the violin for many years starting out a the age of five.&nbsp;
                He gained interest in the instrument through his father who was also a very talented musician.	Mr. Cobos was also asked to play in this special concert by some of his fellow colleagues.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	Everyone seemed to enjoy the performance very much.  It was an honor to be able to attend.
