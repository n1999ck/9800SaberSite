                </i></b></font><font size="1">Chad Wayne / News Editor</font></p>
				
                </font>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On Weds., April 19, the SGA election results were announced.  Incumbent, Eddie Gordon won the election for SGA President with 368 votes.  	His rivals, Jeff Barron and Alan Akin, had 191 and 70 votes, respectively.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	For the position of vice president of finance Alisha McLester beat Robert DeVries 352 to 259.  		All candidates for positions as senators were elected since there were 15 positions open and only 14 candidates running.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	So what does the CSU student body think?  Out of 12 people interviewed, only three knew who the candidates were, and only one even voted.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	None of the twelve seemed to even care who won or lost the election.<br>
	You can do the math yourself - the total votes for SGA President candidates were 629, and the total votes for SGA Vice President of Finance were 611 votes.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	According to Beverly Johnson, the Associate Registrar, there are 4,711 students enrolled at CSU this semester.  That means that only about 13% of the CSU student body voted for the SGA President and Vice President of Finance positions.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	So why didn't any more students participate?  Several students were asked this question.  		Jason Porre a Geology major in his sophomore year, stated in an interview, "Most people, including myself,  aren't aware of what SGA does on campus."&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	When asked his opinion on the SGA election results, John Kocian, an English Major in his junior year, said, "I just don't [care].”</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	One student interviewed, Aisha Kelly, a Biology major in her junior year, voted for the SGA elections.  Kelly's candidates of choice did win; however when asked her opinion on the elections results, she said that she was "indifferent."</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	So why the apathy about SGA elections?  Do CSU students not care about who serves as their voice on campus?  It seems that students are either unaware of what SGA does and/or they feel that SGA is inactive or at least ineffective in pursuing the cause of the students.<br>
	Jason Porre stated that there were no forums for question and answer between the SGA candidates and the student body.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	However, there were three open forums where the students could find out what the candidates stood for.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	The first meeting was at the bell tower about two weeks before election.  Some of the candidates didn't even hear about meeting and almost no students got the word on the bell tower meeting.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	Bill Rogers, a sophomore Biology major, thinks that there ought to be an open forum for students to voice their opinion.  However, this past semester, SGA did instate a forum of that nature in which students can voice their opinions and ask questions about SGA decisions and actions.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	Students also seem concerned about the effectiveness of SGA.  Bill Rogers wants to know, "Do they [SGA] have a voice or does administration just do what they want?"</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	Another student who wishes to remain anonymous says, "I can't think of a single meaningful thing SGA has done for us."</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	In all fairness, SGA has done some important things for the student body.  For one, they brought back the fall graduation ceremony and they have gotten the administration to open the computer lab 24 hours a day beginning in the fall.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	The important thing, though, is that the students are not hearing about any of these SGA accomplishments.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	The general student body didn't seem to be aware that the question answer sessions for candidates were even taking place, nor did they seem to be aware that there is an open forum, held by SGA for students to express their thoughts.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	What can be done then?  We hate to ask you to brag, SGA, but that may be what you need to do.  The student body needs to hear about the accomplishments and even attempts of  SGA to champion the cause of the student body.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	Students seem to want to have personal contact with the members of SGA as well.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	One SGA senator did tell me that he occasionally approaches people individually or asks an entire class what their opinion is on a topic.  That's good.  But we need all the senators to do that.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	On the other hand, some students may need to "wake up and smell the coffee."  SGA puts out a monthly news letter detailing their activities and upcoming events.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	Posters that are advertising SGA events are often seen in the hall ways on campus.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	If students are still not satisfied with what SGA is or is not doing, they may want to visit the SGA office in the Davidson Center to find out how they can make their opinion known.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	 Chances are, there will be a vice president or member of senate that can listen to your ideas or complaints at that moment.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	If not, the SGA secretary, Dennise Rooks can tell when the next open forum will be or she can pass on your written comments to a senator&nbsp;<br>
                for you.</font>
