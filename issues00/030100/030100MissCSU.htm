                </font>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On Saturday, February 19, the Second Annual Miss Columbus State University Pageant, a franchise of the Miss America Company, was held in the Davidson Center Auditorium.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Miss Georgia 1998, April Brinson, and WRBL reporter Brian Sharpe hosted this year’s pageant.  As well as being the previous Miss Georgia, April Brinson is a senior here at CSU pursuing her Bachelor’s Degree in Music Education and is a member of Phi Mu Epsilon.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You might also recall that Brinson won CSU’s first Miss Columbus State University Pageant.  Brian Sharpe, who co anchors WRBL’s morning show, is originally from New York and has lived in Columbus for the past twenty years.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Miss Heart of Georgia 2000, Brea Vaughn, and Miss Columbus 2000, Jennifer Kennedy, also attended the Pageant.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Brinson performed many numbers throughout the program as well as introducing the judges, who had very diverse and active backgrounds.&nbsp;<br>
	Though the crowd was small, those in attendance seemed to enjoy Brinson and Sharpe’s lively wit.  In between it all, the contestants and their platforms were introduced.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Jimbo Davis, Director of Miss Columbus State University Board, says that the requirements needed to become a contestant in the Miss CSU Pageant are the same requirements one must have to join most organizations and athletic teams on the campus.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The requirements are that one must be a female with one semester at CSU, be a current full time student and have an acceptable grade point average.  			There are also rules that the Miss America Company require contestants to have.  These include never being married and being in the age bracket of 18 to 21.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Four young women entered the Miss CSU pageant this year.  Those contestants were Jane-Asher Barnes, Virginia Fay Faison, Catherine Lee Hand and Ashley Johnson.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Barnes, originally from Thomaston, is a junior majoring in special education and her talent was acrobatic jazz.  Her platform was reducing violence in schools.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Faison, a Phenix City resident, is a sophomore majoring in pre-pharmacy, and her talent included vocals.  Her platform was P.R.I.M.E. and
                M.U.S.C.L.E.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hand, from Columbus, is a junior accounting major, and her talent included playing the piano.  Her platform was Breast Cancer Awareness.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Johnson, from Columbus, is a senior majoring in art education, and her talent included vocals.  Her platform was A Simple Act of Kindness.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The four competition categories were interview (40%), talent (30%), swimsuit (15%) and evening gown (15%).&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The interviews were done by Jimbo Davis before the
                Pageant.  The swimsuit competition occurred soon after the Pageant began.&nbsp;<br>
                Davis says that the contestants are allowed to choose their own swimsuit, but they must be approved by him.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The swimsuits must be two inches on the hips and can only be one and half inches below the navel”.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Davis also stressed that “the girls are not allowed to be on stage in their swimsuits for more than 15 seconds.”&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">During the evening gown competition, each contestant was asked to explain their platform.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">April Brinson reminded the audience that the Miss America Company is not a beauty pageant but gave out many awards to young women pursuing a higher education.  She feels that the Miss America Company allowed women to better their lives, gave them self-confidence and boosted public speaking abilities.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When the competitions were complete, the new Miss Columbus State University was announced.  Jane-Asher Barnes was crowned Miss CSU and Catherine Lee Hand was first runner up.  Hand also won the swimsuit and talent competition.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Barnes did not only receive the crown, but she won a one thousand-dollar scholarship and will travel around Columbus promoting her platform.  She will also be attending the Miss Georgia Pageant in June.  			Hand will receive a five hundred-dollar scholarship and will become Miss CSU if Barnes wins the Miss Georgia Pageant this summer.  There were also two $250 scholarships given to Faison and Johnson.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Davis said that the Miss CSU pageant is a year long process, but there has been plenty of support.  	He attended CSU in the 1980’s receiving his degree and came back in the 90’s to obtain his masters.&nbsp;<br>
                He says that CSU is a great school and wanted to remind students, faculty and staff that “this [the Miss CSU pageant] is not a beauty pageant but a scholarship pageant.”&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He feels that the pageant is great exposure for CSU, not only because of the pageant but because it would allow a young woman to get out into the community promoting her platform.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In doing so, the community will know that she is not only from Columbus State University, but she is also trying to help the community.   He says that the title “helps get the foot in the door” to make the community aware or get involved in what may be of concern to them.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Davis also says that this is great attraction of students for CSU.  He says that “the more we [CSU] offer, the better institution it can be.”&nbsp;<br>
                Davis is hoping to have ten contestants in next year’s  pageant and hopes that the pageant becomes big enough to be held in the Fine Arts Auditorium, which holds about 500 people.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There was a charge of ten dollars at the door for non-students as well as a silent auction to raise money for the CSU’s top rated cheerleading team.</font>
