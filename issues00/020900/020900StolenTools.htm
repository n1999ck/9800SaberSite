                </i></b></font><font size="1">Chad Wayne / News Editor</font></p>
				
                </font>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On Sunday, Dec. 5, 1999, at approximately 3:30 in the afternoon, two brothers stole over $10,000 worth of tools from the work site of the new gym.  According to Jasper Cooke, Director of Public Safety, the two thieves have been arrested and are awaiting trial by the state court.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Monday morning, plumbing contractors, Charles and Chuck Booth of Booth Plumbing, reported approximately $8,900 in stolen tools and equipment to the CSU public safety.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Sgt. Boling of CSU Public Safety says that the stolen goods included power tools, grinders, extension cords, cutting torches and some small hand tools that belonged privately to the workers.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The two suspects, one 19 years old and the other 18, were familiar with the work sight since the 19 year old had worked at the site for a short time.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	They broke into two large storage bins known as “gang boxes.”  They loaded the tools into their vehicle that Sunday afternoon and drove off.  After taking the tools from the work site, the brothers transported the tools to their residence in a rural area of Russell County, Alabama.&nbsp;<br>
	Boling says that “they immediately began the distribution of the tools to pawn shops and individuals.”&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	They were selling the goods and would have made quite a profit had they not been caught.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	However, “Neighbors realized the volume of tools that the boys had, and realized that it did not belong to them,” says Sgt. Boling.  In their small community it was difficult to hide an operation of that scale.&nbsp;<br>
	Someone was trying to cover for the brothers and purposefully gave the police a false lead.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The individual said to have seen a blue pickup with three males in  it driving away from the sight on Dec. 5.  The individual also gave a false partial license plate number.  There was no blue pickup and there were only the two brothers.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Eventually an informant told Sgt. Boling of someone in Alabama who might have some information on the burglary.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	It turned out to be a good lead, and Sgt. Boling obtained a Russell County search warrant based on probable cause.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	On Friday, Jan. 21, 2000, Sgt. Boling searched the residence of the two suspects.  The stolen tools were found and the brothers admitted to the crime.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	They even gave all the details of how and when they committed the crime.  They also agreed to turn themselves in to the CSU Police.<br>
	On Monday, Jan. 24, the brothers turned themselves in and returned about $7,800 worth of stolen property.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Since they had already sold much of the property, they also informed the police whom they sold it to.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The two suspects were imprisoned on felony charges.  On Wednesday, they appeared before a municipal judge.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	According to Sgt. Boling, the parents of the two suspects were able to recover more of the property and turned it in to the CSU Police.<br>
	The returned stolen property totaled in an excess of $10,000.  Cooke says that it is common for more property to be recovered that what was reported stolen, since owners usually aren’t aware of everything that is missing.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Booth Plumbing wrote a letter to the CSU Public Safety, thanking them for all their hard work.  		Boling said that Booth Plumbing stated in the letter that “in 30 years, they have never had a single piece of stolen equipment returned to them by the police.”</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Since the crime is a felony, the case is being transferred to a state court.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	According to Jasper Cooke, the two suspects are out of jail on bond right now.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Sgt. Boling says that “there is still a possibility of stolen property being distributed and the matter is still under investigation.”</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	What’s there to learn from all this?  Sgt. Boling believes that there is a moral to this story.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	“This highlights the need for individuals to secure all personal property.  These tools were locked in steel containers in a fenced-in area,” says Boling.</font>
