                </font>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Jasper Cooke, Director of Public Safety at CSU has accepted a position at Augusta State University.  He leaves CSU on Feb. 25, 2000, to fulfill his employment at ASU in a position similar to his here at
                CSU.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Why the move?  Jasper has an opportunity to live in his hometown.  Cooke grew up in Augusta and has built a house there.  He has mixed emotions on the situation.  Cooke finds it difficult to leave CSU, but at the same time, he looks forward to moving back to his hometown.&nbsp;<br>
	“CSU has been good to me,” says Cooke.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Jasper Cooke actually began his career at Augusta State as a public safety officer.  Then he served there as the assistant director of Public Safety for 12 and one half years.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Cooke then served as Deputy Director of Public Safety at Milledgeville University from 1992-97.  Cooke then took the position of Director of Public Safety here at CSU in August of 1997.  And he has been with us now for over two and a half years.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	While at CSU, Cooke has managed the Public Safety Department, which includes overseeing parking services, building security and life safety issues.  Cooke has seen and brought about many changes while serving as CSU’s Public Safety Director.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	When asked what his greatest challenge was while here at CSU, Cooke said, “When I first got here, getting the respect of the community.  Public Safety was not yet an integral part of the CSU community.  Changing the image of the department was the greatest challenge.”</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Cooke believes that community involvement like Sgt. Boling’s columns in the Saber and the Residence Life Newsletter have made for better relations in with the community.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Some of his other accomplishments while here at CSU include restructuring the scheduling of officers.  Through scheduling, Cooke says he has “better man power utilization” than there was before.  When Cooke first came to CSU, there were not always enough officers on duty to serve the students.  He changed the scheduling so that there are more officers on duty during times of higher risk to student’s safety.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Jasper Cooke also succeeded in having the officers’ salaries raised so that they are competitive with other police departments.  Cooke says of the raises, “I couldn’t have done it without the commitment of the University.”</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Cooke also stated that though 20 police officers have been killed on universities across the U.S. none have ever been killed at CSU.  In fact, no officer has ever been shot at under his command.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Cooke says that the most dangerous situation he has seen here at CSU was when Public Safety responded to a murder in Clearview Circle last July.  They responded along with Columbus Police, and the suspect was apprehended without any further injuries or deaths.  Cooke says that his greatest concern was the possibility for another dangerous situation to occur.  He believes that by rescheduling, Public Safety has greatly reduced the potential for dangerous situations.<br>
	When asked what was his greatest moment here at CSU--possibly catching a bad guy--he responded, “I get more enjoyment out of community events than catching bad guys.”&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Cooke recounts his greatest moment as being when Public Safety raised $2,000 for the 1998 Special Olympics.  Not only was a worthy cause given a substantial contribution, but also Cooke says that the fundraiser demonstrated the unity between Public Safety and student organizations.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	“I hope it continues,” says Cooke.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	His immediate professional goal is to earn his Masters in Public Administration, while his long term goal is to be the first Public Safety Director to be the President of Georgia Chiefs Association.  Jasper is currently the Vice President of the Association.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	During his service to the CSU community, Jasper Cooke has been impressed with the dedication of CSU’s management.  “Management seems to be committed for the good of the University.”&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Cooke is especially grateful to Dr. Bagley, Dr. Brown and Mr. Patillo who have been, as Cooke says, “committed to creating a professional Public Safety Department.”</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Will Jasper Cooke be back to CSU?  With a chuckle,he answers, “Never know which way the wind will blow.”</font>
