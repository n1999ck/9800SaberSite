                </i></b></font><font size="1">Jessica Trenchik / Features Editor</font></p>
				
                </font>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Columbus State University was recently honored with the presence of Dr. Guy Bluford, the first African American to go into space, here on campus.  Bluford, CSU’s Black History Month keynote speaker, was on campus February 3 to give a talk about his career as an astronaut, life in space, and the future of space exploration.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	In 1983, aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger, Bluford became the first African American to go into space.  This same mission became another first when it made the first ever nighttime launch and nighttime landing.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Besides the 1983 shuttle mission, Bluford has also flown a Spacelab mission and two U.S. Department of Defense missions.  In all, Bluford has logged over 688hours in space.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Held in the Fine Arts Hall auditorium, Bluford’s presentation was well received by a large audience that included students from local elementary schools. Bluford’s hour-long talk was both humorous and informative.  The audience was clearly sorry to see it end.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Numerous slide photographs helped to enhance Bluford’s talk by visually reinforcing the many topics on which he touched.  The slides included photos of space shuttle equipment, as well as photos taken in space during the actual missions.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	President Brown began the presentation by welcoming the audience and introducing SPC member Bretya Smith.  Smith then introduced Bluford to the audience.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	After a brief introduction, Bluford gave a description of each of the missions he has flown.  The first, as previously mentioned, included a nighttime launch and landing.  For this mission, Bluford and the other astronauts had to “shift their Arcadian rhythm,” which is to say they had to become adjusted to sleeping during the day and working at night.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Bluford’s next mission was a Spacelab mission that he flew in 1985.  The space laboratory aboard the ship was in operation 24 hours a day.  He and the other astronauts performed 76 different experiments during the seven-day mission.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	In 1991 and 1992, Bluford flew his last two missions, both of which were for the Department of Defense.   The subjects of study for the first of these two missions were auroras, earthglow, and stars.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The second of these two missions was classified.  Bluford jokingly told the audience, “If I did talk about that flight, I’d have to shoot all of you.”<br>
	Bluford then went on to describe for the audience the logistics of lift-off.  He described the period of lift-off when the shuttle goes from zero velocity to three times the speed of sound in a matter of minutes as the “equivalent of driving your car over a cobble stone road.”</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The audience was then delighted with Bluford’s account of day-to-day life in space.   He discussed everything from the process of brushing one’s teeth in space to the mechanics of a space shuttle toilet.<br>
	Bluford included many humorous accounts of some of his personal experiences throughout the speech.  One such account, included in the daily life portion of the talk, was about the controversy that arose when Bluford wanted to take a foreign-made electric razor with him for use during the mission.  The controversy was finally resolved when it was decided that Bluford would take two electric razors
                with him aboard the shuttle.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Also during his description of daily life, Bluford dispelled the myth about what astronauts eat aboard space shuttles.  Bluford said he is always amused by the popular misconception that astronauts eat all of their meals in pill form.  According to Bluford, “We basically eat the same meals you do here on earth.”</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	A short summary about the current developments in space exploration concluded Bluford’s speech.  Bluford briefly discussed the international space station currently under construction.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	According to Bluford, the station will include three different laboratories, one for use by America, another for Europe, and still another for Japan.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Right now four pieces of the space station are up.  Bluford says it will take another 40 launches to have it completed.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The first crew to man the station goes up this year.  This crew will begin experimentation as well as help finish with the building of the station.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The station is expected to be complete in the year 2004 or 2005.<br>
	A short Q&amp;A period followed Bluford’s talk, in which he was able to take a few questions from the audience.</font>
