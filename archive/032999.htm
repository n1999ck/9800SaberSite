<p><strong><font size="3">U.S. leads airstrike on Yugoslavia<br>
</font><font size="1">Athena Curry / Editor-in-Chief</font></strong><font size="2"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The United States led NATO forces Wednesday in NATO&#146;s first attack
on a sovereign state, Yugoslavia. The battle over the tiny country of Kosovo has grown
bloodier as the week comes to an end. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">According to CNN, U.S. missiles hit a large Yugoslav air base at
Batajnica, radar facilities in Montenegro and other military targets in Kosovo.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">In this battle, the largest air strike since World War II, 23 cruise
missiles or more were launched from U.S. warships in the Adriatic Sea Wednesday. Dozens of
NATO jets took off from air bases in Italy and NATO planes shot down at least two Yugoslav
fighter jets, according to many reports.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Strikes continued through Thursday as thousands of ethnic Albanians
continued to flee the fighting in Kosovo. Friday strikes continued.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Yugoslavia&#146;s official Tanjug news agency claimed three NATO planes
were shot down; the Pentagon denied the report. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The U.S./NATO attack came after peace treaties drawn up for Serb leaders
by the U.S. were declined. The peace plans would give ethnic Albanians autonomy but not
independence. Another part of the same plan would allow 28, 000 NATO peacekeeping troops
into Kosovo.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">President Clinton Wednesday called the bombing, &#145;a moral
imperative&#146; to end the ongoing oppression and murdering of innocent Kosovars. The
idea is that bombing now will prevent the loss of American lives in a larger war. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Friday Clinton made an appeal to Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic,
to give in to peace demands and end the fighting. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">According to CNN, Clinton, in a taped speech delivered via satellite,
told Serbs that NATO and the U.S. had &#147;no quarrel&#148; with them, but that Milosevic
had &#147;diminished your country&#146;s standing in the world.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#147;I call on all Serbs and all people of goodwill to join us to seek
an end to the needless and avoidable conflict,&#148; Clinton said in his address. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The fear of many Americans is that U.S. ground troops maybe called on to
fight the escalating battle in Yugoslavia. Troops nearby in Bosnia are increasing security
measures. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Of the ultimatum Clinton gave Milosevic, peace or war, Milosevic seems
to have chosen war rather than to give in to NATO and U.S. peace demands. </font></p>

<p><strong><font size="3">Centa remembered<br>
</font><font size="1">Lisa Grant &amp; Athena Curry / Staff Writer &amp; Editor-in-Chief</font></strong><font
size="2"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">With the death of Dr. David M. Centa, Columbus State University lost one
of its most valuable assets last week. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Dr. Centa, Psychology Professor, took his life Monday morning in his
office on campus.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">For many, Dr. Centa was a teacher in the true sense of the word. Dr.
Centa&#146;s family, many of his friends, colleagues, students and former students took
part in a memorial service, &#147;A Time for Remembrance&#148;, held in his honor Thursday
night.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">One by one, people walked, some crying, to the podium and told stories
about what Dr. Centa meant to them. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Many of the stories were funny, some were touching and others profound. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">One professor told the story of how, while visiting India, Dr. Centa was
treated for a stomachache by a shaman. It was after the fact that Dr. Centa realized that
part of the shaman&#146;s ritual included marijuana smoke. Dr. Centa spent much of his
last hours in India preparing for the plane trip home by attempting to wash the smoke from
his clothing. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Several students and former students told of how much Dr. Centa meant to
them and how often he went the extra mile. Students talked about a chair in his office,
which was always available for students to sit in and just talk. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Dr. Centa was portrayed as a very sensitive and thoughtful man. One
student told of Dr. Centa&#146;s attempt to convince her to adopt the lab rats at the end
of experiments. She also said that every time she sees a bow tie she will fondly remember
Dr. Centa, whose signature accessory was colorful bow ties. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Another student said Dr. Centa was the most challenging teacher she had
ever had. He expected the best out of his students and his classes were tough and
demanding, according to many students. Students said Dr. Centa challenged them to think,
analyze, and criticize. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Two colleagues of Dr. Centa&#146;s for over 20 years, Dr. Mary Schild
and Jeanne Dugas, spoke at the memorial, saying that his shoes could never be filled. Dr.
Schild spoke of Dr. Centa&#146;s longtime dedication to the school and his students. Dr.
Dugas remembered sharing recipes and gardening tips with Dr. Centa. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">His former wife, Jeanne Centa and their daughter, Michelle, were present
and spoke with others at the memorial. Dr. Frank Brown, President of the University also
attended and spoke. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Dr. Centa was, at times, a controversial figure, who kept students
thinking and talking.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Many of his philosophies, particularly, the fact that he was very
outspoken about his atheism, upset some people and gave others pause to consider his point
of view. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">He once said that a most important task was to attempt to encourage
others to open up their minds to possibilities other than beliefs that have been
indoctrinated in them. He did this amid criticism, ridicule and mockery, but he held fast
to his convictions.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Dr. Centa had been with the university since 1970. He taught
introductory psychology classes and several upper level psychology classes such as
Pseudopsychology and the Paranormal, Sensations and Perceptions, Physiological Psychology,
Behavioral Studies, Learning Cognitive Psychology, and Comparative Psychology. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Dr. Centa specialized in neurological functioning and behavior. He also
believed in the value of critical thinking and taught students how to look at things from
a logical point of view. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">He graduated in 1967 from Kent State University in Ohio and received his
Master&#146;s degree and Doctorate from Auburn University. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Dr. Centa was a volunteer assistant fire chief and was recently accepted
to go to Russia on a Fulbright grant. He was twice nominated for Educator of the Year.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Dr. Centa traveled extensively. He visited England on a CSU grant and
traveled to Mexico four times between 1987 and 1995. He visited his daughter in Japan in
1993, spent 100 days in India on a Fulbright Visiting Professorship grant in 1995 and
spent 10 days in the Amazon rain forest of Peru in 1998.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Dr. Centa will be missed by many on campus and elsewhere. Dr. Dugas read
a poem, Funeral Blues, at the memorial service. She said, &#147;It says a lot that he
liked this poem.&#148; A copy of the poem, by W.H. Auden, follows this story. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><small><small>Funeral Blues</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,<br>
Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,<br>
Silence the pianos and with muffled drum<br>
Bring on the coffin, let the mourners come.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead<br>
Scribbling on the sky the message He Is Dead,<br>
Put crépe bows round the white necks of the public droves,<br>
Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>He was my North, my South, my East and West,<br>
My working week and my Sunday rest,<br>
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;<br>
I thought love would last forever: I was wrong.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>The stars are not wanted now: put out every one;<br>
Pack up the moons and dismantle the sun;<br>
Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood;<br>
For nothing now can ever come to any good.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>-W. H. Auden</small></small></p>

<p><strong><font size="3">Flesh-eating germs and Chaplin movies; this is college<br>
</font><font size="1">Clarissa Andrews / Staff Writer</font></strong></p>

<p><font size="2">If you&#146;re like most students, you&#146;re probably tired of classes
in which all the professor does is lecture. Of course, not all lectures are boring, but a
change would still be nice. What many people don&#146;t know, however, is that there is a
wide variety of classes offered at CSU that include much more than lectures. Quite a few
of these classes are open to everyone, no matter what your major is.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">One of these interesting classes is CRUJ 2116, a criminal justice class
called Victims of Violence. Instructor Dorinda Dowis, assistant professor in the criminal
justice department, says that one of the aims for this class is to get away from the
typical lecture format. Dowis&#146;s class, offered as an elective with no prerequisites,
is usually pretty full with around 70 students. For extra credit, students participate in
activities outside of the classroom. Once a month, students join VOCAL (Victims of Crime
Against Leniency) meetings to show their support for victims of crimes such as spousal,
child, and elder abuse, rape, and homicide. Last week, students could take part in Sexual
Assault Prevention week activities. Dowis says &#147;[the class]looks at the plight of the
victim, who is ignored and gets back into the limelight only as a witness or part of the
prosecution&#146;s case.&#148; Dowis says, the textbook is &#147;easy reading, but packed
with information.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Another interesting class students don&#146;t know much about is THEA
1315, Acting for the Non-Major. Steven Graver, the instructor, states that the goal of the
class is to teach students &#147;the basics of acting: how to move on stage, theatre
language, relating to each other on stage and to the audience.&#148; The class also
focuses on building character and loosening up, which can be great for shy people. Graver
recommends the class to people who have never had experience onstage as well as those who
have had experience. Being in the class involves performing small scenes and playing
theatre games that attempt to focus attention on body parts. Graver believes his students
&#147;really seem to enjoy the class.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">ENGL 2147, Introduction to Film, is yet another unusual class offered at
CSU. Just imagine, going to class to watch movies . . . Instructor Patrick McHenry says
the purpose of the class is to &#147;study the history of film-making and the theories
used to watch films.&#148; These movies can include anything from silent films, such as
&#147;City Lights&#148; by Charlie Chaplin, westerns, film noir, which consists of dark
scenery, nighttime scenes and anti-heroic heroes. This is also a chance for students to
see independent films that are usually not shown at Columbus movie theatres. This class is
small, with about 25 people, and students usually find the class very interesting.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">If you&#146;re looking for a class to fulfill the science section of
your core, astronomy is a great course to check out. There are two courses that require no
prerequisites, ASTR 1105 (lecture) and ASTR 1305 (lab), which are held at the Coca-Cola
Space Science Center. Shawn Cruzen, the instructor of these courses says both of the
classes are interesting, but the lab involves more hands-on experience. For instance, in
the lecture, students learn how telescopes work, but in the lab, students actually learn
how to use telescopes. In fact, one of the extra credit options for the class is a trip to
Callaway Gardens with the Space Science Center&#146;s portable telescopes to observe the
skies outside of the city. Cruzen explains that the astronomy classes are held off-campus
so students have access to the facilities, which include a planetarium and an observatory.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Another class in the science area is Assistant Professor Jettie
Lights&#146; &#147;Killer Germ&#148; class. BIOL 1125 examines deadly bacteria, parasites
and viruses that threaten the human race. Not a class for the squeamish, Killer Germs
includes films detailing the symptoms of flesh eating diseases and lectures on viruses,
which inspired movies like &#147;Outbreak&#148;. The class, however, does not
sensationalize the pandemics studied, rather offers a realistic view of the very
interesting and scary microscopic world of viruses.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Finally, we come to the most unusual class of all&#151;art professor
Donna Livingston hopes that this May will be the beginning of a new class called Topics in
Art History: Contemporary Art in New York City. She hopes that, in the three week course,
students will spend the first and third weeks in class, but the second will be spent in
New York City. This is modeled after a class offered at Valdosta State University, and the
cost will be under $500. If Livingston&#146;s plans work out, this course will be open to
all students. Plans for the week in New York include attending plays and visiting museums,
then writing a paper on what was learned upon their return to Columbus.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Registration time is coming up, so hopefully these classes have shown
you that there is life beyond lectures. There are many other interesting classes&#151;just
open up your academic catalog to find them.</font></p>

<p><strong><font size="3">Students display diversity in week-long fair<br>
</font><font size="1">Bridgette Brumbaugh / Staff Writer</font></strong><font size="2"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Last week, international students had the opportunity to share their
culture with the community. During Cultural Diversity Week, 15 students set up displays in
the Columbus Room to share information about his or her home country.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Several Asian countries were represented. South Korea had books,
ceremonial masks, a flag, and a video with traditional activities. Macau was represented
with maps, money, pictures, and brochures. The China display had dolls, figurines, photos,
and wildlife tapestries. Japan had a large display with toys, rap music, playing cards,
and several tapestries.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">America was represented with a Native American display. This display was
the largest and had several museum-type pieces. Items ranged from ceremonial war clothes
to biographies of famous American Indians. A war ax, shields, and arrowheads were included
in the display.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Canada also had a large exhibit. There were several books, magazines,
and newspapers from various Canadian regions. Canadian money and their flag were on
display as well. The Prime Minister&#146;s Photo was also part of the display.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Dominican Republic was represented with several items. This display
had a flag, money, coffee and various figurines. A ceremonial outfit and a drum could also
be seen. A lot of brochures on their beaches were shown.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Panama had a small, but interesting exhibit. A flag, maps, and a
tapestry were present along with dolls, postcards, and newspapers.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Hungary was represented with lots of information. A video with folk
dances was being shown in the exhibit. Pages of the history of this country were displayed
on the wall for spectators to read. Folk dancing dolls and shoes were with the display.
Books and currency were also included.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Several students had small, but informative, displays. Russia was
represented with coasters, cups and a flask. Germany had beer steins, dolls, and a piece
of the Berlin Wall. Zimbabwe had food menus, books with wildlife, and maps. Mali was
represented with tapestries depicting animals, various clothes, and accessories. THe
Uganda exhibit included traditional clothing.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Depending on when they were available, the international students could
be seen wearing traditional clothes at their displays. One of these students was Ut Chu,
the Macau representative. She wore a very colorful outfit to represent her country. She
has been in the states for about 5 years and enjoys sharing information about her country.
Franciska, the Hungarian student, could be seen wearing her traditional winter attire at
her display. She has been In America for 8 years.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">This was the second year for this event, which is held every March.
According to Cathy Anderson, the purpose of this event is for international students to
meet others and share about their homeland. The turn out this year was about 30 people a
day.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>ON CAMPUS</strong></font></p>

<p><strong><font size="3">Within a Room<br>
</font><font size="1">Leslie Maxwell / Columnist</font></strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Spring is in the air! Unfortunately, so is the pollen. The beautiful
weather is here, along with millions of things that make us scratch, sniffle, and sneeze.
I think I&#146;ll be the first one in line, however, to trade in my winter colds and flus
for a few springtime sniffles.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">I just moved to Columbus this year. My home is in South Georgia,
literally &#147;in the sticks.&#148; I have spent most of my life over the river and
through the woods (over three miles through the woods to be exact). I used to come home
from school everyday and tromp through the woods surrounding my house. There, I always
knew when spring decided to pop its bashful head out of a hole somewhere and begin
littering the world with flowers and birds&#146; nests.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">I&#146;ve been so busy lately that spring sort of crept up on me. The
weather isn&#146;t very important to me when I spend most of my time writing papers in a
room with few windows, and the poor, trampled strip of grass in front of my apartment
building looks half-dead year-round. I guess I first noticed spring last week when I
started to get in my yellow car (which, by the way, is normally blue). I looked around me
and realized that my favorite time of year had arrived without my customary welcome.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Until now, I have lived in Columbus quite contentedly, but this week I
have missed my home in the &#147;boonies,&#148; where no one except the bumblebees and the
blue jays see the symptoms of my spring fever. I could go lie on the grassy knoll beside
the student center, soak up sunshine, and commune with nature, but I would at least like
to maintain the veneer of sanity (just for all of you who haven&#146;t learned the truth
yet). </font></p>

<p><font size="2">I did give in and wander aimlessly around campus for half an hour
yesterday, because I couldn&#146;t stand being inside during such superb weather. I think
that if we all suffer from a little springtime A.D.D., it&#146;s okay. Now is the time to
get out, frolic, and soak up everything that Mother Nature has to offer, because soon,
we&#146;ll be cursing the heat and paying homage the air conditioner. So, if anyone wants
to join me on the grassy knoll, be sure to bring the Benadryl!</font></p>

<p><strong><font size="3">Public Safety means YOUR Safety<br>
</font><font size="1">Sergeant Jim Boling / Public Safety Officer</font></strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Some of you may have read in the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer last week
about the formation of a seven-county mutual aid compact to counter terrorist threats in
the greater Columbus region. This consortium of law enforcement agencies, fire
departments, and other emergency services groups (including the CSU Department of Public
Safety) has the &#147;hardening&#148; of the area as a target for all forms of terrorist
activity as its main goal.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Before you start thinking that there is no risk of terrorism in our
peaceful (usually) little community, be advised that the threat is definitely real. One
factor which makes this region vulnerable is the prevailing attitude that &#147;it
can&#146;t happen here.&#148; Failure to perceive a threat and devise counter measures is
the first chink in the armor sought after by would-be terrorists. If they can make their
statement with little or no risk to themselves, they are more likely to attack a low
profile target than a more obvious one which is better protected.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Who presents a threat to us? A virtual alphabet soup of organizations
might find reason to attack our community. The most obvious are the foreign-sponsored
groups with a political agenda which includes weakening our military. Not only is Fort
Benning a viable target, but our own ROTC might be seen as a symbolic target with not much
associated risk. And, in the case of ROTC, it&#146;s not only foreign agents who might
consider it a worthy target, but also domestic extremists of both the left and right.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Another &#147;soft&#148; target on almost every university campus is the
science program, especially if animal testing is part of any on-going research. While
groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) might limit their outrage
to a demonstration or picket line, their more radical cousins in the Animal Liberation
Front (ALF) have been known to blow up and/or burn down facilities which they viewed as
exploitative of animals. A similar split has occurred in the environmentalist movement, as
the radical EARTH FIRST! group has been surpassed in violence by the Evan Meacham
Environmental Terrorist International Conspiracy (EMETIC).</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Take this information seriously, folks. The best means we have available
to reduce our risk/vulnerability is an informed and aware community. Knowing that the
threat is real and that each of us has to do our part to observe and report activity which
may be threat-related, will &#147;harden&#148; our position and maybe make the bad guys
look elsewhere for victims.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Recently, University College hired Ms. Eudene Thomas as a Peer Counselor
and Student Advocate. She is a graduate student in Justice Administration, and she is
scheduled to graduate in summer.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Thomas brings a wide variety of experience to her job. She moved to the
United States from Barbados when she was a teenager. She served in the Air Force, and she
is a Vietnam veteran. Ms. Thomas lived in California for part of her life, and she says
that there she developed her adult character and had her best opportunities. There, she
earned a degree in business management in Lomalinda, California, worked for the City of
San Diego, and gained experience in public speaking and youth work.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">In 1992, after spending four years in Barbados, Thomas returned to the
U.S. and eventually moved to Georgia. In 1996, she worked with the Olympics, in
special-seating ticket sales for people with disabilities. She began attending Clark
Atlanta University and eventually transferred to CSU to pursue her graduate studies.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">In her job here at CSU, Thomas performs several roles. She has set up a
series of work shops entitled &#147;Knowledge is Power&#148; for University College
students. These workshops address topics such as test anxiety, study skills, and financial
aid. For more information about these workshops, contact the Counseling Center at 568-2233
or Thomas at 568-3626.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Thomas is also a Peer Counselor and student advocate. She is available
to provide informal counseling with students who need help sorting out problems, managing
stress, or finding direction in their studies. Since she is a non-traditional student,
Thomas is well-prepared to help students who are juggling work and family as they struggle
to adjust to college life.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">As an advocate, Thomas helps facilitate problem solving between students
and their department.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Thomas says she is available for the students and the workshops are
being offered, but not many students are responding. She says, &#147;I wish the students
would take advantage of the services that are here. It is not only very important to get
an e cation, but also to enjoy the educational process. I am here to help students take
advantage of the opportunities that education gives them.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Women should rule the world<br>
Part II</font></p>

<p><font size="2">What would happen if women ruled the world...</font></p>

<p><font size="2">This past week I have been putting this question to several CSU
students. I was disappointed by the male opposition I received about this two part series
on women. While most of the male students I questioned were eager to give me a response,
there were some who launched into stories of how they felt about the women&#146;s right
movement. &#147;Why does it matter who rules the world? Women have not been as suppressed
as they would have the world believe,&#148; they say. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">I personally disagree with their opinions, but hey...each to their own.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">So, what did many of your fellow students say would happen if women
ruled the world...</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#147;There would be a lot of fat happy women and no crime.&#148; <br>
-Ginger Grantham</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#147;If women ruled the world...it would be a matriarchy.&#148;<br>
-Arris Ray</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#147;Women already rule the world!&#148;<br>
-Brandy Hopson</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#147;We would still be in the dark ages because women are always
late!&#148; <br>
-Jeremy Norman</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#147;Nothing! The women who would be in charge would become just like
the men who are in charge now...lying, deceitful politicians who only look out for
themselves.&#148;<br>
-Anonymous</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#147;The toilet seat would always be down.&#148;<br>
-Gerilyn Keyser</font></p>

<p><font size="2">And finally...my personal favorite...</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#147;Women can rule me anytime!!&#148;<br>
-John McCann</font></p>

<p><font size="2">How do I feel about this issue? Like I have already said, I think women
need to be given a fair shot at being in control. Men have been in charge far too long. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Maybe it is not fair to blame the multitude of our problems on a single
group of people, but a growing number of our population would agree with me when I say
that I am unhappy with the things that have occurred in our male dominated world. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">A women in the 90&#146;s has more power and opportunities to excel in
society than all the generations before her. It is the era of the women, and it is about
time. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The shock of Dr. Centa's death is still evident on campus. A memorial
service was held Thursday night in the Davidson cafeteria as an informal forum for those
who knew and loved him to speak about what he meant to them, tell funny stories and just
reminisce. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">However, caring sentiments are not the only ones I've heard speak about
Dr. Centa's suicide. In fact, I've been appalled at the lack of tact, empathy and
understanding of many on campus.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Wednesday morning I heard several people in different areas of campus
speaking loudly about their opinions on the subject and their opinions about atheists and
suicide in general. Many expressed a poorly thought-out rationale that the world would be
a better place if all the atheists on campus would, &quot;blow their brains out&quot;.
This attitude, and especially the openness of sharing such a bigoted, compassionless point
of view, shocked me. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">As an atheist, I felt threatened by the small groups of people huddled
here and there exclaiming their relief that there is one less atheist around. Many of
these people proclaimed to be Christians. As I've stated, I'm not a Christian, but it is
my understanding that Jesus taught tolerance and peace. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">I heard people express the notion that because Dr. Centa was an atheist,
there was no reason for him not to kill himself. I would like to clear that up also. As an
atheist there is plenty of reason for me not kill myself. I believe this is it, one
opportunity at life. I have my son, my family, my career, and my life as enough reason to
keep me here. I can not explain what David Centa did, no one can. But atheism does not
breed suicide any more than Christianity prevents it. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The fact is atheists are human beings that deserve the same respect as
everyone else on this campus and in this country. The same sort of comments made about
nearly any other group of people would spark outrage. Somehow many feel that those with
differing religious views, or those without religion are free game. Many openly present
bigotry against non-theists as an ideal not only to be accepted, but to be embraced.
However, it is bigotry just like any other kind and it is hurtful and damaging. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Dr. Centa was a vehement opponent of the CSU creed. He cited many
reasons for opposing the creed, but one main reason was that he felt the creed was
unenforceable. He said to me on many occasions that it was impossible to demand that
people respect each other and somehow enforce that they do so. It is ironic that if the
creed could be enforced, these people would be held responsible for violating the code of
the university. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">I feel certain that if these people knew me or knew Dr. Centa outside a
classroom, they would reconsider their views on atheists. That's not to say that they
would take on an atheistic philosophy, but perhaps then they could see us as people. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Another person on campus expressed his opinion that since Dr. Centa
committed suicide, he should not be memorialized. I agree that suicide is not the answer.
I believe that the memorial held on campus was to ease the suffering of Dr. Centa's loved
ones and not in any way a tribute to the act of suicide. Dr. Centa's actions will never be
fully explained. However, we do not know what was in his mind. We can not even rule out a
chemical imbalance in his brain or clinical depression. None of this changes the fact that
to many, Dr. Centa was an important, loving person who should not be judged for one act in
a lifetime of events. It is unfair to remember one moment in the life of a man who brought
so much into this world. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">We live in a country where we are supposed to be free to believe what we
wish, to accept or decline any view, religion, opinion or idea. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">I urge those students who had such harsh words this week to think about
what they are saying before they speak. I would like to believe that these comments were
made out of ignorance and flippancy and not out of hatred. Many of these students' voices
were riddled with anger and contempt, while somehow worse, others were indifferent and
apathetic. I watched Dr. Centa's daughter cry over the loss of her father Thursday night,
and I believe most of these students would reconsider their views if they understood that
Dr. Centa, atheist or not, suicide or not, was a human being.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Letters to the Editor</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Dear Editor,</font></p>

<p><font size="2">I am writing in regards to the recent events surrounding Dr. David
Centa. I am still profoundly shocked and saddened. Dr. Centa has been a professor of mine
for a year and as difficult as his classes were he was quite an inspiration to me. He
challenged us more than any professor I&#146;ve had. Dr. Centa was one of the most
intelligent men I have ever encountered and his dedication to reason and rationality
inspired me to re-start the CSU Freethought Society. It feels surreal to even be writing
this letter but for those who did not know Dr. Centa, I feel it is imperative for everyone
to know what a dedicated teacher he was. This school and the psychology department has
lost a tremendous asset. School is never going to be the same to me again. I&#146;ve heard
of some ugly things being said around campus and some of it is to be expected but the
degree of cruelty and ignorance that these things are being said surprises even a cynic
like me. He has affected me in a way that I cannot look at life through the same eyes
again. I am grateful for that and for his wit, humor and unmatched perception. Goodbye,
Captain.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Lisa Grant,<br>
CSU Student</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Dear Editor,</font></p>

<p><font size="2">I think I can speak for most of the psychology majors who have passed
through classes of Dr. David M. Centa&#146;s when I say that he will be sadly missed. Dr.
Centa was a well qualified educator who worked hard to see that students really learned
what he taught. All of us knew that Dr. Centa&#146;s classes were challenging, to say the
least. To earn an A on a test or overall in his class was quite an achievement. You could
be proud of what you accomplished if you did well in Dr. Centa&#146;s class.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">It is only fitting that his death has caused us all to stop and think
because this was his goal in teaching to force us to stop and think, to use our minds and
reasoning skills. Dr. Centa was not afraid of being controversial because he had the
knowledge to back up what he said and he wanted you to have the knowledge to back up what
you said. It wasn&#146;t good enough for him to say &#147;I don&#146;t know&#148;. I
can&#146;t think of a question that he did not have a scientific explanation for. I only
wish we had an explanation for why he chose to do what he did.<br>
Although I did not agree with many of Dr. Centa&#146;s views, I respected him and I truly
appreciated his knowledge of the subject of psychology. Dr. Centa always treated me with
respect and kindness. Even though I abhorred his little bow ties and the work I knew I
would have to put into his class, I&#146;ll miss Dr. Centa, but I&#146;ll never forget
him. It&#146;s sad that he did not know how valuable his life was. Columbus State has lost
a great educator and we have all lost a very special man. I am grateful to Dr. David M.
Centa and the entire psychology department for a very positive learning experience at CSU.</font></p>

  <li><font size="2">Last week our campus was forced to bear witness to one of the most
    heinous crimes against humanity, the taking of one&#146;s own life. I did not know Dr.
    David Centa; however, I know those people that did, and his death has taken a great toll
    on them. I have listened to students on the campus talk about how his death has affected
    them and have been shocked by the comments of some. People were not upset that a long time
    professor had taken his life. Nor did they feel sorry for the man who felt he had no where
    to turn for help. Students did not grieve for this man but instead, some were saying that
    his death was good that it rid the world of one more &#145;non-christian&#146; heathen.
    Yes, Dr. Centa was an atheist. He does not believe in God or any of the other teachings of
    the Bible. Dr. Centa was a minority in this, the Bible Belt of the United States. And now
    those people who presume that his beliefs are wrong are ostracizing all those with the
    same belief. I&#146;ve heard some students say that the world would be better off if all
    the atheists killed themselves. So does that mean that all groups in this country who
    believe in something that others disagree with should also die? This doesn&#146;t exactly
    reflect the Christian attitude of forgiveness and love that we have all been taught. I
    myself was raised in a Christian environment. I spent my young adulthood being the good
    little angel that I needed to be. But in college I have been introduced to completely
    different and unique people who practice a variety of lifestyles and beliefs. Aren&#146;t
    we all supposed to expand our horizons in college and learn to be more tolerant of others?
    When we are sent out into the real world we will have to work with people who may believe
    in everything that we were taught will get you sent to hell. And how will we deal with it
    then? I can&#146;t run from things that I fear anymore than you can. And we fear that
    which we do not understand. So many of you may not understand the beliefs of those around
    you but you must learn to accept them. One day you may be the one who believes something
    different and experiences exclusion-and on that day you may begin to pray for acceptance.</font></li>

be treated as just a rumor. If this is true, it would be a great loss to the wrestling

Kanyon will once again join forces. Their gimmick is probably going to be that you never
know which of the three will be wrestling. This is very similar to the way the Fabulous
Freebirds ran their tag team in the early 1980s. It made the Freebirds one of the best
wrestling groups ever, but this new group is nowhere near as talented as the they were.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Look for a few things to happen this week. In WCW, Hollywood Hogan will
still look more and more like the old Hulk Hogan, and the fans will continue to eat it up.
Ric Flair will continue to do everything he can to get the fans to boo him. There should
be changes in the Four Horsemen soon, and Barry Windham will have something to do with
this.</font></p>

they say?&#148; the priest inquired. &#147;They only know how to say, &#145;Hi, we&#146;re

produce license and registration, police say he could not and proceeded to give them the
name Robert Diggs, which is the real name of the Wu-Tang Clan&#146;s Rza.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">When ODB finally gave the police with his real name, they found that he
had six suspensions on his license as well as one count of failure to pay child support.
Police then say that they searched ODB&#146;s car and found three envelopes containing
crack.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">ODB recently went into into the studio to work on his upcoming album
&#147;Nigga Please,&#148; but was being held by the police when I was writing (and
laughing at) this. Hopefully they will hold him long enough that he will forget that he
was working on another album - come on, what did we do to deserve that?</font></p>

</font><font size="1">Tonya Euell / Xi Theta</font></strong></p>

<p><font size="2">On March 6, 1999, Xi Theta had the opportunity to work with Big Brothers
Big Sisters at the Bowl for Kids&#146; Sake fundralser. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Volunteering for BBBS is becoming a habit for us. For those not familiar
with BBBS, they help children who live in single parent homes find someone who can be a
big brother or sister to look up to, to be guided by. Sometimes there just doesn&#146;t
seem to be enough people out there who can give their time and emotion to take on such
endeavors. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The parties that BBBS throws for children are the most gratifying. Xi
Theta has gone to three BBBS events this year and has enjoyed participating in every one
of them. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Bowl for Kids&#146; Sake fundraiser was great. When we got our face
paints and make up ready for painting the children&#146;s faces, another volunteer at the
event came to us and said we looked as though we were having fun. We were. When we get
together with the children and out of the college limelight, we seem to relax more and are
able to think more on the level of an innocent child. We are able to forget our upcoming
exams and the twenty-page paper due the next Monday and relax completely.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Along with painting children&#146;s faces of the children and selling
ducks to help raise more funds, we were honored to meet prominent members of the Columbus
Community, like Mayor Peters and Congressman Bishop, as well as the news staff of WTVM. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Xi Theta would like to thank all the children for fond memories and
Stefani Fullerton who came down to volunteer with us! Xi Theta would also like to take
this time out to welcome our new pledges, Sherri Moore, Dina Welling and Kim McAfee.
Welcome Ladies!!!!!</font></p>

<p><font size="2">If anyone is interested in becoming a big sister or brother or helping
with BBBS events, please contact Xi Theta and we will pass the information along.</font></p>

<p><strong><font size="3">Congratulations, Delta Zeta!<br>
</font><font size="1">Stephanie Adams / Delta Zeta</font></strong></p>

<p><font size="2">For the second consecutive year, Delta Zeta Sorority has won the Rape
Awareness Week display competition. The prize was a trophy and a cash prize of $50. As a
female organization on this campus we feel that is important to support this issue that
directly affects women all over the world. We were proud to participate with
representatives of the other sororities on campus in the Take Back the Night Candlelight
March that occured on March 24, 1999. United as women we stood up for our right not to be
victimized. All of the organizations that have participated this week, male and female,
should be proud of the work they have done to bring the facts of this issue to light.
Again, I would like to congratulate my sisters in winning the contest and continuing to be
&#147;The Best Organization on Campus 1999.&#148; </font></p>
