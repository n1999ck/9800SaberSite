Hello<br>
</font><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="1">Amy Walters / Editor in Chief</font></strong></p>

<hr size="1" noshade color="#003264">

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The recent announcement of archaeologists’ findings in Egypt may shed new light on the culture of people who lived in the Roman-Egyptian empire over 2,000 years ago.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">What archaeologists have found is an expansive mass grave that may contain the mummified bodies of as many as 10,000 people, including children and complete families, buried together.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The graves were found in the Bahariya Oasis, 230 miles southeast of Cairo. A man riding through the desert stumbled upon the site when his donkey’s foot fell through a hole into one of the tombs.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Zahi Hawass, director of the excavation, stated last week that they were aware of the tombs three years ago but that the site was kept secret so that it would not be of interest to looters. The excavation was begun five months ago but only now are pictures being released.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As of now there have been 105 mummies unearthed in the underground tomb that is estimated to stretch under a two square mile section of desert.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	This is the first Egyptian tomb found this century that has not been previously looted before it was discovered. Subsequently, the bodies are well preserved due to the lack of human contact and the dry desert air.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The fact that the tombs have not been looted has allowed researchers to see the mummies as they were originally buried. From the first data that has been released it is thought that the people were from wealthy, but not overly rich, families. They did, however, have enough money to be buried with some extravagant materials.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The bodies are elaborately decorated with gold masks and adorned with jewels. The tombs are also decorated with cartonnages, linen and plaster-like casket coverings.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hawass described one cartonnage as depicting a man wearing a funeral crown surrounded by nature scenes and goddesses shielding him from danger with their wings.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">With this recent discovery, archaeologists hope to learn about the people and culture of the period including what they ate, how they died, what illnesses they were affected by, and how many children the women had.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Excavation will resume in November and soon the tomb will be open to the public.</font></p>

<hr size="1" noshade color="#003264">

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	On August 25, the Student Programming Council and Student Government sponsored welcome back events for CSU’s student body. Among these events were the Cougar Picnic, held in front of the Clock Tower, from 11:30 a.m.-2 p.m.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The picnic gave students the chance to win door prizes, listen to music provided by local radio station B101 and socialize with other students.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	There was also a student organization fair set up by campus groups interested in recruiting new members. Some participating organizations were the Counseling Center, CSU Cheerleaders, Baptist Student Union, Georgia Coalition on Donation, CSU Psychology Club, and Freethought Society.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Student Government also held a welcome back party for the night students in and around Howard Hall.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	There was also a party in Davidson Cafeteria sponsored by SPC. This year’s theme was “Party like it’s 1999.” The cafeteria was decorated with purple balloons and streamers. The party included a DJ, food, and games such as name that tune, name that movie sound bite, and, of course, a dance contest.&nbsp;<br>
	This is the fourth year that this has been done and is only one of several parties that will be held this year by
SPC.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Student Programming Council will also begin a Brown Bag Series and a Coffee House.&nbsp;<br>
	All of the SPC events are free of charge to CSU students.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The Student Government Association will also be holding campus events this year as well. SGA will be holding its first forum at 12:30 p.m. on September 9.  Policies and events relating to campus will be discussed. Student organizations will be represented and the meeting is open to all students.</font></p>

resigns<br>
</font><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="1">Amy Walters / Editor in Chief</font></strong></p>

<hr size="1" noshade color="#003264">

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Sam Holmes, the vice president of scholastic affairs for the Columbus State Student Government Association, submitted his resignation last Thursday.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Holmes ran against two others for this position in the spring semester of last year. He replaced Grant Salter who served in this position for the previous two terms.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In his resignation letter, Holmes stated that there were a variety of reasons for this sudden decision. He cited that his expected graduation date in May 2000 put excessive pressure on his class schedule. He also stated that the “demands of the music department, as well as music activities outside the school” made him “less visible in Student Government.”</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Holmes also made the point that if he continued with student government that the “organization would not benefit as it should, making it unfair for the student body as a whole.” He wrote that he thanked all those that supported him while he was active in SGA either as a representative, senator or executive officer and said that the experience in the organization would “benefit him in future career endeavors.”</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The vice president of scholastic affairs handles events and issues of an academic nature within student government. Responsibilities that are included in this office are the SGA sponsored Halloween carnival, selection of educator of the year, planning of the advisor of the year luncheon, and the assignment of senators and representatives to committees.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	According to SGA President Eddie Gordon, applications are being accepted for the vacancy. He said that interviews will begin next week and a new vice president should be presented at the first forum meeting on September 9.</font></p>

<p><strong><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="3">Tryouts for dance and
cheerleading<br>
</font><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="1">Clarissa
Andrews / Staff Writer</font></strong></p>

<hr size="1" noshade color="#003264">

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	If you’re looking for a way to make friends and be part of a team while being actively involved in one of the many extracurricular activities CSU offers, the dance team or the cheerleading squad could be just what you’re looking for.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Jimbo Davis, the coach for both teams, will be holding a meeting for those interested in dance team tryouts on Thursday, September 2, at 12:30 p.m. in Woodruff Gym room 001.  The purpose of the meeting is to discuss what the team is looking for at the tryouts.  The girls auditioning will be asked to perform a dance of their choice, lasting about one minute, to display any particular talents they have. The audition will also include a one-minute dance taught that will include the basics the dancers should know.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to Davis the CSU dance team was started last year, “in order for [the university] to grow, we need to provide a diverse set of [extracurricular] activities.”  Last year’s dance team had six girls, but Davis is hoping the team will have at least 16 members.  No prior experience is needed to tryout-the first few weeks of practice will be for “cleaning up skills” so that the team members will have a similar style of dancing.  A panel of judges will have score sheets to measure the skills, and anyone who gets a score of at least 70 percent will make the team.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Davis says that extracurricular activities make for a greater success rate in the workforce after graduation; just like in a workplace, the girls on the dance team will need to work together as a team, understanding each others’
strengths and weaknesses.  His goal for the team is to “put all of our individual talents out there and get a better product.”  The dance team will compete at least once, in the Peachbowl Athletic Conference, and Davis hopes to make more public appearances this year.  Last year, the team danced at all of the home basketball games, participated in the lighting of the SGA Christmas tree, and danced for CSU’s 40th anniversary celebration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Cheerleading tryouts will be done on a private basis, because the main tryouts are held in April.  “There are nine guys and nine girls on the team now,” says Davis, but he is hoping to have 10 or 11 of each.  If you are interested in trying out for the open spaces on the squad, contact Jimbo Davis at 568-2204 in the Turner Center, room 107.  You must be able to do a standing back handspring, standing back tuck, and a tumbling pass with at least two different tricks.  After talking with Davis, if you meet all of his requirements, he will invite you to practice with the team for about a week and make his decision after that.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	This year’s cheerleading squad is the “closest group of kids I’ve ever had.”  The team bonding is extraordinary-”these are 18 people who are together 99 per cent of the time,” says Davis.  The CSU cheerleaders placed third in the country last year in Division II of the UCA College Nationals, and are on ESPN2 three times a month.  “Students from all over the country come here because it’s a good program and stay because it’s clean.”</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You must have a 2.0 GPA to try out for either the dance or cheerleading teams, and no previous team members are guaranteed a place on the team.  “Everyone has to try out and we put the best kids out there,” Davis says.  After making the team, students sign an agreement-”they know they’re ambassadors to the school, are constantly in the public eye.  We have a clean image.  That’s how we’ve gotten so good.”&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">[caption] </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Students gather outside Davidson Center for refreshments offered at the Back to School Bash on Wednesday, August 25.  This was one of the many welcome back events that was held last week.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The FBI and the Justice Department announced last week that they plan to open a new investigation into the 1993 standoff with the Branch Davidians at their compound in Waco, Texas. The siege culminated in a fire that killed leader, David Koresh, and over 80 of his followers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The investigation was ordered by Attorney General, Janet Reno, and FBI Director, Louis Freeh, a day after the FBI confirmed that they fired what may have been potentially flammable tear gas canisters on the final day of the 51 day siege.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The Bureau insists that they have no evidence that the devices they fired had any cause in starting the fire.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Former Deputy Assistant FBI Director, Danny Coulson, stated that two pyrotechnic projectiles were fired onto the grounds approximately four hours before the fire began. Coulson said that during the time between the firing of the devices and the start of the fire the devices could not have stayed hot enough to ignite a fire.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This new information has come to light recently after former Branch Davidians and family members of victims filed a wrongful death suit, charging that the FBI used incendiary devices that started the fire at the main building of the compound.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Reno and Freeh have appointed a team of 40 FBI agents to re-interview each person who was at the scene on the final day of the siege.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The FBI is denying claims that they kept this information secret from the public and is pushing the blame towards the Justice Department, which completed the final investigation of the incident.<br>
	Reno stated earlier in the week that she was “very, very troubled” at the recent release of information and pledged to “do everything humanly possible to learn all the facts as accurately as possible and make them available to the Congress and public.”</font></p>

<hr size="1" noshade color="#003264">

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lately, it seems as if I can’t get away from one thing
... obscenity.  So I thought that I would complain about it a little bit.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I am all for free speech and free artistic expression, but some of the things I am seeing and hearing are getting on my nerves.  Whether it is obscene language or naked people cavorting on prime time television, obscenity is everywhere these days, and the problem is that most of it is absolutely pointless.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to one definition, obscenity is something that is created to arouse sexual desire or anger, and it has no redeeming literary, artistic, or scientific value.  For instance, no one (except a very disturbed person) is aroused by the statue Venus or by scantily-clad tribal people going about their business on the Discovery Channel.  And furthermore, no one gets really hysterical when Rhett Butler says “Frankly, Scarlett, I don’t give a damn.”</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">On the other hand, some things are entirely unnecessary.  A few weeks ago, I went to the movies with some friends.  The movie we wanted to see wasn’t playing at the late showing, so we were left with a choice between Run Away Bride and The Thomas Crown Affair.  I’m no great fan of “chick-flicks” so we opted for Crown Affair.  For those of you who haven’t seen the movie, it is another high-tech thief flick like Entrapment, but not nearly as good.  Along with a lot of bad acting and a predictable plot, this movie featured Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan in one of the longest, most bizarrely filmed sex scenes that I have ever seen.  My friends and I were looking at each other and saying things like, “Yuck!  When is this torture going to end?”  Then, later in the movie, Rene Russo spends lots of time walking around topless for no apparent reason.  Someone in the theater might have enjoyed that, but I certainly did not see the point.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Can’t two people have a conversation fully clothed?  I hope this isn’t a weird social phenomena developing - I would hate to have to take off half my clothes in order to have a meaningful conversation with someone.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Then, of course, there is the subject of verbal obscenity.  I have a friend who makes me cringe on a regular basis with his colorful and rather limited vocabulary.  For example, he would say something like this:  “I beep went to the beep store and they wouldn’t beepin’ sell me any beepin’ cigarettes ‘cause I beepin’ forgot my I.-beepin’-D. Beep it!”  (censored version).  What is the point of that many curse words?  That sentence definitely doesn’t have any artistic, literary, or scientific value.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The function of curse words, I suppose, is to provide emphasis, but isn’t that function undermined by overuse?  For instance, if I say, “I like chocolate very, very, very, very, very, very, very much!”  Isn’t that sort of inane?  Don’t you get the point after the first “very,” and don’t I sound stupid after the second one?  That sentence sounds like it either came from the mouth of a very enthusiastic three-year old or from some one who has nothing between his or her ears but air.  No one demonstrates much intelligence by mouthing a sentence that contains more vulgarity than sense.  In the words of my foul mouthed friend, “Cuss words are so unin-beepin-ventive!”&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Ah, yes! The sun is shining and the birds are singing, and it’s time to start another year here at CSU! This is a great time of year, and lots of things are new and different, so there’s a measure of excitement, even for the “old hands” who have been here for two or three years.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Most noticeable to you as you drive/walk around campus is all the new construction and building going on. This has several effects, not the least of which is a reduction in available parking for commuters (students, faculty and staff are all affected).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The key to finding the parking space you want is to arrive sufficiently early to allow for the “ebb and flow,” as classes dismiss and others depart. The wrong approach is to rush into the campus at the last minute and park somewhere you know is off limits. That includes parking lots designated for others, grass or a seeded area, yellow-striped zones, etc. All that does is get everyone’s attention — those who planned ahead and parked legally, those who come in later and are tempted to do the same as you have, and folks dressed like me, who are distributing little yellow “gift-certificates” on the windshields of your car and others similarly situated. These little citations are a double-value this year; the fine schedule has increased to $20.00 for routine goof-ups and $50.00 for taking a marked handicapped space from someone who really needs it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The bottom line to all this is to plan ahead, take into account the fact that the university is growing, which limits some facilities during the construction process, and don’t do what you know you shouldn’t. The old expression “Cooperate and Graduate” comes to mind. Have a great semester, and DRIVE SMART!</font></p>

<hr size="1" noshade color="#003264">

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Business major Jason Ezzell, who informed me that he will be 21 in September, is an intelligent and fascinating person; he plays at least five instruments, including drums, guitar, piano, mandolin, and bass, and is currently the guitarist for Digital Cricket.  He listens to jazz and blues as well as bands such as Widespread Panic, Phish, and the Grateful Dead.  Leigh Daniel, Jason’s girlfriend, swears that the Dixie Chicks is his favorite group, but he denies this, saying he prefers the Allman Brothers and Pink Floyd.  Jason does, however, admit to admiring the “great harmony and the songwriting ability” of the Dixie Chicks.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When he’s not in school, Jason works at Art’s Music Shop and enjoys “hanging out with my sweetie, Leigh.  I’m pretty low-key,” he says.  Jason is an animal lover who owns a rabbit and shares a dog with Leigh.  His favorite movie is The Shawshank Redemption (Leigh says it’s really Pretty Woman), and his favorite book is Adrift by Steven Callahan.  “It’s a true story about a man who is lost at sea for 76 days and survives,” he explains.  Jason is no stranger to the sea himself-over the summer, he visited Atlantic Beach, where he entertained himself by surfing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Out of all the characters on Cartoon Network, Jason most identifies with Space Ghost.  This is because, “I like the way he talks.”  His favorite Victoria’s Secret model is Laetitia Casta, which he couldn’t spell without the assistance of Sports Illustrated.  If he could go to Europe and visit only one place, Jason says it would be Stonehenge-he thinks the rock arrangements are “unbelievable because no one knows how they got there.  A lot of people think it was set up to be a calendar for planting, or maybe a temple, but no one is sure.”  Jason is an avid guitar and guitar pick collector; he has ten guitars and about three hundred guitar picks.  One of his favorite picks came from a Kenny Wayne Sheppard concert in Athens - “He threw it out into the audience, and I scrounged it up off the floor.”&nbsp;<br>
	Jason attended Pacelli High School before leaving Columbus to attend the University of Georgia for a year and a half.  Right now, he’s “five hours a way from being a junior.”</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	ELY, Nevada (AP) — Only one brothel remains where there used to be a row three blocks long here, and a bitterly divided City Council voted to shut that one, too. Then the mayor stepped up and rescued the Stardust Ranch.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Mayor Robert Miller vetoed a 3-2 City Council vote on Thursday to ban prostitution. He said he thought brothels provided a place for safe sex.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Supporters of the brothel cited the tourists it brought in and the money spent by the women who work at the Stardust Ranch, all that’s left of the old ‘line’ of brothels in the town of 5,000.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	“I can’t recall one instance in all those years of the ‘line’ giving us one instance of trouble,” said Sunny Martin, 86. “But TV and the computer can bring filth right into your house.”&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Tonja Lemich, 32, a third-generation resident who is raising a child, said she took offense at those council members who want to legislate morality.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	But supporters of the ordinance said officials can and must legislate morality.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“There is not one good thing about a brothel,” said Councilman Stuart Tracy’s wife, Joette. “We have tolerated this negative part of this town long enough.”&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Tracy said the ban is needed to make Ely a better place for families.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Prostitution is legal in 10 rural Nevada counties, where about 30 brothels are operate.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	It would take four votes to override the mayor, and the two members who voted against the ban said they won’t change their minds.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I am a freshman here at CSU.  After enrolling I was excited to learn that this campus had an active Student Government Association and I had hoped to get involved this semester.  At my high school I was very active in our Student Government and I gained invaluable experience.  However, I am very disappointed to report that I will not be getting involved in the SGA this year or any other year until some things are improved.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	After speaking casually to one of the senators, they encouraged me to stop by the office and talk to the president.  What I witnessed convinced me that I have no place in SGA.  Several members of our SGA executive board were having a petty argument, might I say a very loud petty argument.  After observing this argument for several minutes, I decided to leave.  I had no desire to become involved in an organization that aired its personal problems to the public.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Having been involved in Student Government for the last two years of my high school career, I found this to be highly unprofessional.  If our executive board does not have the tact to contain their problems then I have no desire to work among them.  I recommend that whoever is in charge of Student Government investigate to ensure that no other students experience what I did.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	How am I to have faith in the leaders of my school if my initial impression is one of pettiness and childishness?  I have heard very positive things about the persons involved in SGA and I was really looking forward to having the opportunity to work with them.  I may go back another time and see if things have changed.  Until then, I encourage the officers of SGA to try and contain their problems and continue to portray a positive image of Student Government.&nbsp;<br>

<hr size="1" noshade color="#003264">

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	Alright sports fans...let’s get ready to rumble!!!  This week we look at the world of wrestling, and oh what a twisted world it is.  For those of you who are die hard fans of the masters of bulk, you may not like what I have to say.  So strap on your weight belt and hold on to the ropes - let’s talk some trash!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">First of all, if it is not already apparent, I am not a fan of wrestling.  However, I believe in looking at both sides of the issue.  Let’s start with some of the things that people love and hate about the “sport.”  After talking to several students on campus I discovered that many like and dislike wrestling for the same reason.  And what is that reason you may ask - they say it is because wrestling is stupid and fake!!!&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Many watchers of the world’s most over dramatized “sport” expressed that wrestling's stupidity and childishness appeals to them.  They also find it very entertaining.  I guess I could agree that it is pretty funny when grown men strap on leotards and prance around the stage yelling your mama jokes at each other.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Some female students told me that they like wrestling because of the hard bodies!  I have to agree with that one also... But could I make a suggestion: some of those costumes need to be de-drag-queened if you know what I mean.  Talk about tacky.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">So, what don’t people like about wrestling?  Have I already mentioned that it is a sport that requires little intellegence on the viewer’s part?  If you have a brain you can keep up with this “sport.”  There is no strategy involved.  And sugar, I hate to break it to you, but it is entirely fake.  Think of professional wrestling as a male soap opera.  There is a story line and a well rehearsed series of maneuvers.  I have been told by some fans that there is actually some improvisation in wrestling matches, but the bottom line people is that it is not real. Maybe that is why it is so popular.  It is an opportunity to escape from reality.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Not to get too serious on you but let’s examine the fact that professional wrestling promotes violence.  Funny or not, this “sport” is about hand to hand physical competition.  Combine that with constant trash talking and an increasing use of vulgarity and you have what should be considered a situation that is not suitable for children.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I actually worked a concession stand at a wrestling match at the Civic Center last year.  I saw many parents (an alarming number who where under the influence) letting there children run around and pretend to beat each other up.  Oh, but you could probably blame that on irresponsible parenting, right?&nbsp;<br>
	Let’s not blame only the parents for letting their children be a part of this increasingly violent display of testosterone.  Let’s blame those who continue to support the violence in media - but that is a totally different can that can be opened at another time.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Bottom line - I am not knocking the hard work and countless hours that wrestlers spend perfecting their bodies.  I know that takes incredible amounts of stamina and discipline, but professional wrestling is not a true “sport.”  Darlings, it is fake!  Just think of it as a giant ballet.  It is a performance and nothing more.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Oh, and did I mention that the wrestlers themselves don’t help by acting like they have a brain the size of a pea?&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	“Hey, my name is Big Stan... but you can call me B.S.  If you don’t... do... what I say... I am going to beat you with a spatula... sideways!”&nbsp;</font></p>

<hr size="1" noshade color="#003264">

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I think that this week I have suddenly discovered how important the Internet is in this day and age. And it’s not that I’ve used it for my classes or even for writing this paper. As of this week my little colstate email account is the only link I have with friends all over the southeast.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	One of my best friends from high school left two weeks ago to attend a college in Florida. Now I know that Florida is not as far away as California or New York, but for me it’s too far away for her to be. When you are used to talking to someone at least every other day it’s odd not being able to pick up the phone and call them or just drive over to their house to visit. Another friend of mine also moved away this year to attend another college in Georgia. Of course, they are closer than Florida, but still to far away for many visits, especially with the schedule I keep. This was someone I talked to nearly every day of my life last year, so without them to laugh, cry, or just be stupid with it’s almost like they moved to another side of the world.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	With that being said I have become obsessive about checking email. At least four or five times a day I hit the pegasus mail icon on my desktop hoping to have a message from an old friend. I’m like a kid in a grocery store- you know what I mean, when you and your parents went into a store and you couldn’t wait to get to the counter so perhaps you could beg and get a piece of candy or gum. It’s that type of anticipation as I sit down at my desk. Of course, many times I am sorely disappointed (like the child in the store) when I open up my mail and nothing is there (except maybe a forward from my old roommate). But when I do receive a message I sit and read it from beginning to end, hoping to catch a glimpse into what my friends are doing, how their lives are going in their new cities. And as I absorb what they have said I try to think how I’m going to it all that I want to say back into email form (those are the times I really wish they were here for me to talk to).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you have friends that are far away, drop them a letter every now and then. It may brighten their day and, if they get as excited as I do, they’ll probably respond quickly and tell you what’s going on with them. Even if you are having a bad day, tell them about it. They probably want to be there for you and may even have some good advice for you.<br>
<br>
P.S. If anyone wants to send me an email, I’ll be very happy.</font></p>

<p><strong><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="3">Letter to the Editor</font></strong></p>

<hr size="1" noshade color="#003264">

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ms. Walters,<br>
<br>
	Your editorial would be more appropriately titled “A reckless thought”. I really don’t appreciate you encouraging students to disregard the advice of their parents, teachers, preachers, etc. I certainly hope that nobody’s “little voice” tells them to act out violent fantasies such as those carried out at Columbine. I guess the parents of the perpetrators at Columbine should not have been criticized so harshly. After all, those boys were only listening to the voice inside their heads. The results were not very happy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As people such as yourself continue to encourage the blatant disregard of authority, society will continue to become more unruly and lawless. Isn’t it amazing that there was much less school violence back in the 1950’s at a time when kids had much more access to guns than they do now? Of course, that was before we took all mention of God out of schools in order to avoid offending someone. The last thing we want to do is to offend anybody, even if it means telling them the truth. (By the way, the Ten Commandments come from Jewish Law, so I doubt very seriously that you will find any Jew offended by them as you suggested in your previous commentary!)<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
David J. Murphy</font></p>

</font><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="1">Brian Hale / Entertainment
Editor</font></strong></p>

<hr size="1" noshade color="#003264">

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	It has been a long time rumor that many wrestlers in WCW have been unhappy with the working conditions that have been presented lately. The main problem that they have is the constant push of the older stars, while the younger talent is buried in the middle of the card, with less important roles to play.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The trouble actually started brewing when, within several months of each other, WCW stars Jeff Jarrett and Paul “The Giant” Wight jumped ship and went to work for the rival federation, the WWF. Then, in late July, Chris Jericho did the same and immediately went from mid-card to main event stature. Now there are more rumblings about moves being made in WCW. The problem came to a head before last Monday’s Nitro. WCW President Eric Bischoff, in what is considered a gutsy move, offered an OUT in contracts to anyone who was unhappy with the company. Bischoff is said to be fed up with constant complaining by his group of wrestlers. It was reported on WCW Live that at that point only Raven (Scott Levy) had taken Bischoff up on his offer.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	According to Internet reporter Bob Ryder, there were several wrestlers singled out for their constant complaining in recent months. Among them were Konan, Raven, and The Public Enemy, with only Raven making the move, or so we thought.  It was also reported by Ryder that Billy Kidman later approached Eric Bischoff with regard to being released and was initially declined. However, Kidman later recanted and Bischoff agreed to release him when he got back to Atlanta.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	To further add to the possible defects from WCW, a source close to this situation states that Buff Bagwell has likewise asked for an early release from the company. Bagwell has only five months left on his contract and up until that point hadn’t been approached by WCW with regard to renewing his contract. An unidentifiable source says that it is likely that Bagwell will be granted his release from the company. Ryder reports that after the meeting several wrestlers headed for pay phones. A source states that the extent of said calls are unknown and would be pure speculation at this point, but there just may be more defects or attempts to defect from WCW over the next few weeks. It is not believed by this source that all who are requesting releases will have them granted.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	So what does this mean for wrestling? It means that Bagwell, Raven, Kidman, Randy Savage, and any other unhappy WCW star could end up in ECW or WWF any time after their release is granted. This is indeed a gutsy move by WCW.  The company will go much farther and be a better product with stars that want to be there. The downside to the move is that WCW could lose a great number of the younger talent like Chris Benoit, Buff Bagwell and Dean Malenko, while older stars like Hulk Hogan, Sting, and Kevin Nash dominate the headlines. The problem with that is the older stars is just that – they are older and closer to retirement. Where will this leave WCW if the fallout of the last week is a large defection of talent? We can only wait to see, but I would be happy if I were a talent booker for ECW or the WWF.<br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	In the early 90’s Johnson discovered he was HIV positive and dropped his musical projects to spend more time painting and working on his autobiography.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
	Sheryl Crow has always shown that she has good musical taste, and now she has proven it again. Crow had a jam session with The Artist (formerly known as Prince) at the Lilith Fair stop in Toronto last week. The former Prince joined Crow on guitar and vocals during the performance of her hit song “Everyday Is A Winding Road.”&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	This is not the first time Crow has been joined on stage by some of music’s greatest. In the past few months, Crow has shared the spotlight with Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Willie Nelson, and Chrissie Hynde, the Pretenders’ frontwoman.&nbsp;<br>

	Speaking of The Artist, his former label Warner Brothers will once again try to cash in on his old name and material by releasing “The Vault... Old Friends 4 Sale.”&nbsp;<br>
	“Vault” is a collection of ten previously unreleased tracks, a few of them dating back to 1985.<br>
<br>
	In other music news, it appears that I have done something terrible, evil, wrong, or just been a jerk to one too many people. God is punishing me for something. How do I know this? Well, Melanie C., better known as Sporty Spice of the painfully annoying group called the Spice Girls, has a solo album coming out. MTV reported that Sporty will be making several club appearances in New York to support her new album. I had to have done something really bad to deserve this. I am sorry.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">All Greek organizations are wonderful and have many things to offer everyone, but you may find one a little more to your liking than the others. The following steps will help you make that decision:&nbsp;<br>
<br>
1.) Attempt to be as neat as possible in appearance. Dress for Success!&nbsp;<br>
2.) Ask each fraternity or sorority what they expect of a pledge—time, grades, etc.&nbsp;<br>
3.) Familiarize yourself with fraternity names and their pronunciations.&nbsp;<br>
4.) Find out what the financial obligations are. How much does it cost monthly, etc.&nbsp;<br>
5.) Remember you are a guest in each fraternity or sorority house—act accordingly.&nbsp;<br>
6.) Do yourself a favor by looking at all fraternities or sororities prior to pledging. There are great people in all.&nbsp;<br>
7.) Remember that choosing a Greek organization is YOUR decision! Friends can be helpful, but don't let them influence your decision.&nbsp;<br>
8.) Try to keep an open mind; we know that all the names involved with Greek life can be confusing, but remember we are all here to help you.<br>
9.) Be objective about your decision. Remember, it is the members that make the organization.  Find a place where you are the most comfortable, you can obtain the best college education, and can contribute as well as benefit the most.&nbsp;<br>
10.) And most of all, just sit back, relax, and enjoy yourself; after all, these are the best years of your life!&nbsp;</font></p>

HISTORY&nbsp;<br>
	Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., the nations leading black sorority was founded in 1913 at Howard University by 22 dynamic young women who were members of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. In 1912, there was a split between those who preferred the more socially oriented program to those who wanted to create one of service, community involvement and political actions. Our founders were determined to establish a sisterhood with Greek roots as well as one dedicated to public service. On January 13, 1913, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority was founded. Today that determination has blossomed into a vast organization of over 190,000 doctors, lawyers, congresswomen, actresses, school teachers, corporate executives, and countless other professions, diligently working to continue the legacy.<br>
	Theta Phi chapter received our national charter on June 3, 1971. The charter line consisted of 20 members. Theta Phi chapter involvement include: Thanksgiving baskets, volunteering for CCSC, hospice, and T.E.A.R.S, fund raisers for the UNCF scholarship, sponsoring programs like the Infectious Disease seminar and numerous other community service projects and involvement.<br>
