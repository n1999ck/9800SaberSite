</font><font size="1">by Helen Godwin / Associate Editor</font></strong></font></p>

<hr noshade color="#3D477B" size="1">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">[picture caption] With construction well under way, it will
not be very long before Burger King provides CSU students with another food option close
to campus.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Columbus will soon reap the benefits of a trip back in time
to an old fashion trolley station.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Schuster Enterprises is currently building a new Burger
King on Gentian Boulevard, across from the Columbus State University campus. The theme
coincides with Columbus&#146; future plans for a trolley system to service CSU and Flat
Rock Park.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">With a predicted open date of early June, this
&#147;trolley station&#148; will have all of the modern conveniences. It will feature
Burger King&#146;s infamous talking trash cans and an indoor playground.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Burger King&#146;s dining area will seat 200 and there will
be two rooms available to reserve for meetings or parties. One room&#146;s theme will be a
model train car and the other will have an old-fashioned diner motif.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This new restaurant will have a drive-thru designed to
facilitate those in a hurry and looking for convenience.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you want it your way right away, according to Schuster
Enterprises, Burger King is the place to go because there are 1,024 possible ways for a
customer to order a Whopper sandwich.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The landscape, according to Schuster Enterprises, Inc.,
&#147;is designed to create a neighborhood-friendly atmosphere.&#148; This is why the
parking lot is separated from the drive through and there will be many outside lights.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Not only will this business benefit the stomachs of
Columbus, but also the economy. This facility will employ 50-75 people and its payroll
will be over $500,000 annually.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Faculty and student reaction has been very positive.
Graylen Bishop, a part time instructor at CSU says, &#147;It will be good for the college
because it is an alternative. It would behoove them (Schuster Enterprises) to build a
cross walk like what is on Victory Drive just so that it is safer for the students to
cross.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&#147;Having competition close by will affect our sales, no
matter who it is,&#148; says Dan Silver, Food Service Director at CSU, &#147;but, we are
starting to offer various benefits to choosing us over other restaurants like combo meals
so that instead of Burger King being competition for us, we can be competition for
them.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Schuster Enterprises, Inc. owns and operates 11 Burger
Kings in Columbus and Phenix City. This new Burger King will be the 55th restaurant in the
Schuster system.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A leader in today&#146;s fast-food industry, with locations
in all 50 states and 56 countries and territories around the world, Burger King
Corporation was founded in 1954 in Miami, Florida, by James McLamore and David Edgerton.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Since its Florida beginnings more than 43 years ago when a
Burger King hamburger cost 18¢ and a Whopper sandwich cost 37¢, Burger King Corporation
has established restaurants around the world &#151; from Australia to the Bahamas, and
from Venezuela to Hong Kong.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Today, there are more than 300,000 Burger King employees in
more than 9,400 locations worldwide.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><font size="3">CSU recruitment doesn't miss the boat<br>
</font><font size="1">by Clarissa Andrews / Staff Writer</font></strong></font></p>

<hr noshade color="#3D477B" size="1">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As spring semester is drawing to a close for CSU students,
many high school juniors across Columbus are anxiously awaiting SAT scores, updated grade
point averages, and class rankings so that they can mail their transcripts to universities
near and far. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Due to a new junior recruitment program at CSU, the
admissions staff is hoping those juniors will consider mailing their applications across
town rather than across the state.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">According to Joel Judah, president of SGA, local high
school students, &#147;may not be aware of how great CSU is - our goal is to make them
aware of what&#146;s in their own back yard.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In order to do this, members of the Offices of Public
Relations, Admissions, University College, students, faculty, staff, and alumni have
worked together to devise ways to get Columbus high school juniors&#146; attention.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Cheryl Gaston, Director of the Public Relations, says that
since January, four contacts have been made with about 300 juniors from Columbus. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">First, an information packet consisting of pamphlets, a
hand-signed letter from the president of the University, a video, a CSU front license
plate, and a CSU car sticker was sent to every junior with a GPA of 3.0 or higher, who is
actively involved in his or her school. These students were recommended by their guidance
counselors. Also in the information packet was an invitation for the students and their
parents to attend a free pizza party on Sunday, May 2. The party offers prospective
students a chance to walk around the campus, meet students and faculty from their areas of
interest, and talk to outstanding young alumni, among other things.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The second contact with the students was a phone call made
by CORE students in admissions, followed by a service leadership brochure. The latest
contact was a second invitation to the pizza party. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Although the reply card count is fairly low so far, Gaston
has high hopes for success in the new recruitment attempts. She says that by not making
sure Columbus high school students had this information in the past, CSU was really,
&#147;missing the boat.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This year, however, Public Relations, Admissions, and all
other groups involved are assuring that local students realize what a wonderful school CSU
is. Gaston claims that many people&#146;s ideas about the University have changed in the
past six or so years, but she is still convinced that the local market does not know us as
well as it should.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">One of the best aspects of this project is that it will
last through the fall, not just ending with the pizza party. Every interested junior will
be in contact with a person from CSU, either a student or a faculty member, and should
receive personal letters from the contact periodically to maintain interest levels.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Gaston says it is important to recruit students through
personalization, not just sending out information about the college. &#147;The best way to
tell our story,&#148; she states, &#147;is through the people who are experiencing
it.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><font size="3">SGA Elections today<br>
</font><font size="1">by Bridgette Brumbaugh / Staff Writer</font></strong></font></p>

<hr noshade color="#3D477B" size="1">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Student Government elections are being held today and
tomorrow and all students have a chance to vote on which candidates they want representing
them. The student government affects various aspects of student life and the
responsibilities of this organization, as well as its members, should be considered.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Student Government Association&#146;s members vote on
policies, academic activities, and monetary issues, which affect the student body. A few
issues brought before the Student Government included parking ticket disputes and money
requests.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The association is divided into an executive council, a
voting forum, and a judicial branch. Each branch has specific responsibilities for the
elected officials.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The president has control over all committees and is
responsible for making sure each one is addressing their area of concern. This person is
the official representative of the student body and is a delegate to the Board of Regents.
He or she serves on the activities committee, alumni council, and any other committees
required by the university. The president appoints a secretary as well.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The vice president of scholastic affairs formulates
policies involving academic areas affecting students. He or she is chair of the annual
social and philanthropic projects of the group and serves on the activities and curriculum
committee.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The vice president of finance prepares a budget, which is
approved by the executive committee, and oversees all budget amendments and money
requests. This person advises the executive committee on money issues and serves on the
activities committee.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Senators vote on various issues, serve on committees, and
voice their opinions. They work to get student issues addressed in forum.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The chief justice presides over the judicial council and is
the judge in cases of controversy. He or she advises the executive council on
constitutional matters upon request. The chief justice writes the majority opinion and
files reports with the appropriate officials.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Elections are being held from 8 a.m. - 8 p.m., at the
Davidson Center outdoor dining area. If it rains, the voting booth will be located inside
the Public Safety Lobby of Davidson. Each student must show a picture ID and names will be
verified on the official CSU roster.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><font size="3">Help for writers<br>
</font><font size="1">by Leslie Maxwell / Staff Writer</font></strong></font></p>

<hr noshade color="#3D477B" size="1">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Many colleges and universities around the country have
writing centers where students can consult with peer tutors in order to improve their
writing skills. CSU has now joined these colleges and established a writing center of its
own, staffed with trained peer tutors. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">At this time, the Writing Center is operating out of the
Writing Lab, which is located in Arnold 207. Tutors are available by appointment to help
students with their assignments. Appointments are available during a variety of times, and
they last 20 minutes. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Noreen Lape, who has been instrumental in creating the
CSU Writing Center (WC), says, &#147;The Writing Center is a great place for writers of
all abilities to go, share ideas, and improve their writing skills.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The peer tutors who staff the WC have been through a
semester-long training course. They are trained in a variety of techniques, and they can
assist a student in any stage of the writing process. Tutors can help students understand
an assignment, brainstorm ideas, or, if the student has a draft of a paper, the tutor can
offer suggestions for improving it. In addition, tutors can explain teacher&#146;s
comments or answer questions about paper formats, such as MLA style.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mrs. Cathy Fussell, coordinator of the Writing Lab, says
the WC is a &#147;place outside the classroom where students can talk about writing and
become immersed in the academic community.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Many students do not have a chance to engage in academic
conversation outside of the classroom, so the WC serves as a place to talk informally
about papers and generate ideas.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The WC also gives students a chance to receive feedback
from a peer instead of their instructor since many students seem hesitant to approach
their instructor with questions that seem &#147;stupid&#148; or &#147;insignificant&#148;.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Lape, who teaches English 1101 and 1102, says,
&#147;Many of my students who have used the WC have shown great improvement in their
writing skills, and they are becoming more confident and better writers.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The English faculty and the WC peer tutors hope that
everyone will come and explore the new services that are being offered. </font></p>

</font><font size="1">by Clarissa Andrews / Staff Writer</font></strong></font></p>

<hr noshade color="#3D477B" size="1">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">After graduation this May, most students are planning to go
out to eat with their families and close friends and then go home to veg out in front of
the television, resting their brains for the first time in years. Other students who still
have a while before graduation will probably do the same, just without the going out to
dinner part. If a Saturday night in front of the television doesn&#146;t sound appealing
to you, the Student Government Association is offering a better plan.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">On Saturday, May 15, at 8:00 p.m., SGA will host the first
annual &#145;Last Nite Out&#146; Party. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The event, held at the clock tower, will be open to all CSU
students to provide an opportunity for everyone to come together one last time.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">SGA President Joel Judah says, &#147;Our hope is that [the
Last Nite Out] will help to build more of a cohesive spirit among the students of
CSU.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Refreshments will include soft drinks and finger foods,
such as chips and dip. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Although Judah says there will be music, it is unsure
whether there will be a band or a disc jockey.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Plans for the celebration began at an SGA executive council
committee meeting when the members discussed ideas to give CSU students something to do
after graduation other than go home. SGA is hoping that at least 1,000 people will join
the fun and that the weather will be nice. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Judah says, &#147;It&#146;s our goal to give back to
students, and this is just another way to give something back.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">All of the signs &#145;round campus advertisin&#146; the
&#147;Festival of Southern Culture&#148; have made me start thinkin&#146; about what
&#147;Southern Culture&#148; really is, and what makes it different, say, from
&#147;Northern Culture.&#148; Now, I&#146;m not talkin&#146; about &#147;You might be a
redneck if...&#148; southern culture, or pick-up truckin&#146;, rebel flag flyin&#146;,
Harley Davidson tattoo-type southern culture. I&#146;m talkin&#146; about the regional
cultural differences that most of us are never even aware of until someone points them
out.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For instance, there is a huge difference in the way
northern people and southern people give commands or offer suggestions. A northern person
might say, &#147;This is wrong; do it this way,&#148; but a bonafide South Georgia peach
like me would choose a more indirect route. I would say, &#147;Are you sure this is what
you meant to do? I might be wrong, but it seems to me that it would work better this
way.&#148; A southern person hears that statement as &#147;This is wrong; fix it,&#148;
but the northern person is thinking, &#147;Why doesn&#146;t she just say what she
means?&#148; So to the southern person &#147;Do it this way&#148; sounds a little harsh,
while to the northern person, southern indirection sounds a little wishy-washy.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are also some words, beyond &#147;y&#146;all&#148;
and &#147;pop&#148; that are only used in certain regions. Consider the word
&#147;MASH&#148; for example. A southern person would say, &#147;Hey, what button do I
MASH to turn this thing on?&#148; A northern person would reply, &#147;Mash? You mean what
button would you PRESS to turn that thing on?&#148; And so the interminable arguments
continue: y&#146;all or you guys, pop or coke, and of course, pécán, pécan, or pecán.
Of course, I think y&#146;all know that I drink a coke (even if it&#146;s a Mountain Dew
and I eat pécáns (that&#146;s pronounced pee-ca-ans).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">My parents work for a northern family that owns a large
hunting plantation in South Georgia, so all my life, I have been around people from up
north. I can&#146;t tell you how many times I have heard, &#147;I just love the way you
talk. It is so adorable. Say something else.&#148; I&#146;m surprised that I&#146;m not
emotionally scarred.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Last summer, however, I had my first chance to visit the
New England states. I remember sitting in a New Jersey restaurant with my family,
listening to the people at nearby tables. I was thinking, &#147;I can&#146;t believe that
they come down south and think I sound funny; listen to them!&#148; However, I did have
the good grace not to ask the waitress to repeat herself simply for my listening pleasure.
I came home from that trip with a new understanding of how northern people hear us when
they visit the south. Good gracious, we must sound funny!</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Personally, I think that regional dialects and cultural
variations are fascinating. We all just need to remember that in the &#147;melting
pot&#148; of America, some ingredients, like dialects and customs, just refuse to melt. We
will never all be the same, but then again, isn&#146;t a tossed salad more interesting
than tomato soup? People aren&#146;t defined by regional idiosyncrasies; instead, they are
enhanced by them. I wouldn&#146;t give up my southern twang or my Harley Davidson boots
for anything, but that&#146;s just my opinion; I might be wrong...</font></p>

presenting Islam accurately to students.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">On April 12 and 13 the Islamic Association hosted an
exhibit in the lobby of the Fine Arts Hall. Displays included posters, books, brochures on
the history and beliefs of Islam, prayer rugs, Marhaba (used in prayer), books comparing
Christianity to Islam, information on the roles of men and women, tea pots and cups, money
from Egypt, a wooden stand used to hold the Qu&#146;ran while reading, and a picture of

<hr noshade color="#3D477B" size="1">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The phone rings - you pick it up. Someone on the other end
asks for &#147;George,&#148; or &#147;Mary,&#148; or whatever. You inform this unknown
party that they have the wrong number, but before you can hang up, he/she says something
(it could be anything) that catches your attention, and pretty soon you&#146;re chatting
like old friends. You wouldn&#146;t know this person from Adam, yet you talk, and he/she
talks, and before you know it, you&#146;ve exchanged names, addresses, signs of the
Zodiac, etc.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Imagine the same scenario happening via computer. It seems
like everyone has email today, and the same possibilities for meeting people exist in that
medium as via &#147;wrong number.&#148; The problem is, the person you&#146;re chatting
with by email may be in the same room with you, hunched over their keyboard while watching
you.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Should you worry about any of the above? You bet! Since the
dawn of time, there have been predators and stalkers out there; now, however, they can
satisfy their weird obsessions by electronic media, instead of running the risk of being
caught by physically following their victims. Can they reach through the WWW or the
Internet and attack you? Well, yes and no. Their attack may be emotional or psychological,
rather than physical, but it can hurt just as bad. Even worse, they can charm their way
into your confidence over a period of time, until you are actually willing to arrange a
physical meeting. That&#146;s where it really gets dangerous. No matter how long you have
&#147;known&#148; this individual, you don&#146;t really know them at all. Don&#146;t EVER
attempt a rendezvous such as that by yourself. You are walking on extremely treacherous
ground even with someone along, but to keep a solo appointment with a total stranger is
just asking for trouble.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Remember the &#147;wrong number&#148; phone call - you
wouldn&#146;t rush out to meet that person (face it, they&#146;re too stupid to dial the
correct number, anyway, OR, they&#146;re just out to lure you into something you
don&#146;t want to do), so don&#146;t treat the &#147;Cyber-pal&#148; any differently.
They still are strangers, and like Mom always said: &#147;Don&#146;t talk to
strangers.&#148; It&#146;s still good advice.</font></p>

students are running, they are unopposed, requiring at least one vote to be elected.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Eddie Gordon</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Eddie Gordon is a psychology and criminal justice major. He
has been in Student Government for two years, and is currently vice president of finance.
While serving as senator, he was awarded &#147;Senator of the Quarter,&#148; as well as
being appointed to speaker of the senate. He says because of his involvement with SGA, he
has had no time to devote to other organizations. He wants to help students by having an
SGA open house for students to get to know their representatives on a personal level.
Also, they would be able to ask any questions of the Student Government officials. He
says, &#147;If elected, I will make sure all money will be allocated for student use. I
will not award funds to non-students or non-student organizations, which has occurred
under former presidents.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Amy Walters</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Amy Walters is a music education major who has been
involved in Student Government since August, when she was appointed secretary. She has
served on various committees through her secretary position, and worked on most events
that were sponsored by SGA this year. She is President of Mu Phi Epsilon, a national coed
music fraternity. She feels she can benefit students through the connections she has made
in other campus offices as secretary, and will know whom to contact to solve
students&#146; problems. If she is elected president, Walters says she will address
concerns including improved academic advising and working towards the development of a
campus wide excused absence policy. She would also like to see more students, as
individuals and as members of organizations, become involved with Student Government. She
says &#147;I want all organizations on campus to get involved with SGA, so we can learn
from each other.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Heather Elwood</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Heather Elwood is majoring in biology. This is her first
experience with SGA. She is a member of Tri Beta, a biology honor society. She feels she
will benefit students because she listens to the needs of others and works hard to meet
those needs. She believes she is well rounded and is very convincing, which she believes
is beneficial for students. She says, &#147;I will try to get the student voice
heard.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Sam Holmes</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sam Holmes is a music education major. He has spent 4 years
in SGA, 3 as a representative and 1 as a senator. He is also president of CMENC
(Collegiate Music Educator&#146;s National Conference), a 77 member group; state vice
president of CMENC; a member of Phi Mu Alpha; and resident life assistant at the dorms. He
believes he can help the students because of his years of experience on campus. He knows
the faculty and students, and knows how things operate. He says, &#147;My future goal is
to continue to build on the steady foundation of which the current administration has
established.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Matt Olesin</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Matt Olesin is a biology major. He has been involved with
SGA for a year working as a senator and speaker of the senate. He is a CSU Cheerleader and
is on the Orientation Team. He also works as an EMT for 911 in Phenix City. He feels he
can benefit students because he holds the university in high regards and will apply this
standard in his work. He lives by the motto, &#147;You can do the impossible if you set
your mind to it.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Travis White</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Travis White is majoring in pre-engineering. He has been
involved with SGA since he was appointed as a senator 2 months ago. He currently works in
the registrar&#146;s office. He believes he can help students by implementing an open door
policy for students to discuss whatever is on their mind. He comments, &#147; I want
organizations to know what funds they can receive and how.&#148; Travis is running
unopposed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Jason Harrison</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Jason Harrison is majoring in biology. He has served in SGA
for a year, as chief justice, and has served on several committees. He is also involved in
Tri Beta, the biology honor society. He feels he can continue to help students by
refunding money paid for unjust parking tickets, $150 worth so far. He says &#147;I will
protect students&#146; rights.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Shannon Miller</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Shannon Miller is a communications major with an emphasis

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Show me the money!</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When I began doing research for this article I had no idea
that I would wind up in the middle of something so complicated. All I wanted to do was to
find out how much of Student Government &#145;s money could be used for organizational
needs on this campus. Do yourself a favor- don&#146;t go looking for any answers in the
SGA office. They can barely agree on what kind of coffee to drink.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I have received conflicting information from people who are
supposed to be working together to help the student body. For example, I went seeking
information about the SGA budget. As a member of a social organization of this campus, I
have always thought that SGA had some money set aside that organizations could request.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Want to know what I found out? SGA has a yearly budget of
$30,000. After looking over a copy of the 1999-2000 Student Government budget it became
clear that $14,000 of this budget is set aside for supplies, events, and organizational
needs. Well, surprise, surprise. According to certain persons in the SGA office, this is
simply not true. No amount of the budget was ever meant to be set aside for organizational
needs. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Organizations have received some money as a courtesy over
the past couple of years. I&#146;m sorry... I must have been mistaken...poor little
ole&#146; me, I must have forgotten how to read. Here is a direct quote for a copy of the
1999-2000 Student Government budget that I received from someone in the SGA office
(don&#146;t worry boys, it&#146;s all about freedom of information).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&#147;Account #95-30-1-31-101-000-71400&#148; This account
is for all supplies, events, and (this is a shock) ORGANIZATIONAL NEEDS. It started out
with $14,000 for the school year of 1998-1999. Supplies have been purchased from places
such as K-Mart, Wal-Mart, and Chapman&#146;s. $3,000 of this money was used for the 1999
Homecoming Ball at the Bradley Theatre.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I have documentation of eight organizations that have
requested money from Student Government this year. Of these eight, three organizations
were denied and none of the organizations received the full amount they requested. Some of
the organizations that received money even had their own budget. Less than $1100 has been
given out, according to my documentation, since February 2, 1999. If this doesn&#146;t
upset you, it should.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">So where did the rest of the money go? Well, I want you to
go find out for yourself (be aware that you will probably be told everything is DYNAMITE,
ain&#146;t that right J.J.)? </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">First of all, I think campus organizations should make an
effort to become aware of the services that are available to them. From what I understand
the whole concept of the SGA forum has become a joke. For those of you that don&#146;t
know...SGA is made up of elected executive members, elected senators, and appointed
representatives from the various organizations on campus. The executive council must
pre-approve (or in many cases pre-disapprove) any document that will be voted upon before
it can go before the forum. Once in the forum the executive council will make its
recommendation to the forum and they vote. What is so sad is that the majority of the
senators and representatives are in such a hurry to get out of there that they don&#146;t
even question the executive council&#146;s recommendation. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You are probably thinking, wait a minute... I thought she
was angry at the executive council. I am angry with all the parties involved. I put my
trust in my representative to act in the best interest of my organization while in the SGA
forum. How can she though, when questions are not encouraged and everyone seems to think
that what the executive council says goes (Hey... that sounds good to me, you ready to go
grab a beer). </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">According to one source, even if a person does question the
recommendation of the executive council it may damage their ability to get further
business passed (there&#146;s no reason to hold a grudge...can&#146;t we just kiss and
make up). Even worse, the executive council, according to my sources, has never made an
effort to educate the senators and representatives about the policies and procedures
involved in these types of meetings. We are told that we must have a representative at
each meeting. They will have one recognized vote and if they miss more than two meetings
then that organization will not be recognized on this campus! Off with their heads!!!</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This is a two way street. The student body has much more
power than they realize. Stop complaining and go find out what exactly the rules are.
Don&#146;t take someone&#146;s word for it just because they convinced 77 people to vote
last year to elect them into office. That&#146;s right, only 77 people voted in the
election last year. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Speaking of those who are in office, don&#146;t think I am
not grateful for all the work that you do. There are tons of things that our executive
members do behind the scenes that the average student is not aware of. We are
grateful...extremely grateful. But...(oh you knew it was coming), I would much rather you
be interested in me as a person. How many of you take the time to actually listen to the
opinion of the ordinary student. We may be misinformed and un- involved, but when someone
you have never met tries to tell you that there is a problem with your job you should
listen to the underlying meaning. Bottom line... the students (those of us who give a
damn) are unhappy with certain things. We need clarification on certain facts, not just
your usual line of bull. I have no interest on engaging in a conversation with someone
whose soul direction is to make me feel like I am a complete idiot. Enough said- I think I
have made my point. I would just like to say that I wish the students were more interested
in what happens on this campus, and I wish that the powers that be were more interested in
the average student. We can&#146;t complain about things on campus and not do anything
about it. You have a voice... use it. For those to whom we give the power to work for us
can also use the power to work against us. I will end by quoting the campaign speech I
received from a person running for senator, &#147;Vote for me... I promise I will try to
go to at least half of the meetings.&#148;</font></p>

</font><font size="1">by Brian Hale / Entertainment Editor</font></strong></font></p>

<hr noshade color="#3D477B" size="1">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Well, hello there. I hope everybody is having a good week
so far. This is going to be a little bit different this week ... I am just going to
ramble. I&#146;ve got some things that I need to get off my chest, and hey, I&#146;m
getting paid for this too. Can&#146;t beat that with a wet noodle, can ya&#146;?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It has been a crazy time for me in the past few months.
Heck, the past week has been insane. We all have so many choices to make everyday, and
they all bleed over into someone&#146;s life besides our own. I wish that maybe we could
stop and see what the consequences of our actions would be before we did some of the crazy
stuff we do. I suppose things would be a whole lot easier then. Of course, then life would
not be nearly as interesting.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I guess what started this whole &#147;I better look at my
life&#148; kick I am on right now is something that happened three weeks ago. I, along
with many others, lost a friend recently, who took his own life. Something big was
bothering him and it was bothering him in a big way. I saw him the day before he died, and
did not notice that something was wrong.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">That is my point - we see each other every day, but what do
we notice about each other? Do we even care to notice? Sometimes I don&#146;t. I need to.
We all need to. To the friend I&#146;ve lost: I am sorry.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Recently there have been several things going on in my life
that ended with somebody getting hurt. I am sorry that things have happened the way they
did, but I am sure they happened for some reason - other than the simple and obvious
reason that I am an idiot. Life goes on.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Okay, Okay, Okay, I&#146;ll bring this to an end, but first
I want to point out a song, a poem actually, but it is getting played on the radio a lot
these days. This song touches on many of the issues to which we all need to pay a little
attention. I do.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&#147;Ladies and gentlemen of the class of &#145;99: Wear
sunscreen. If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. The
long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my
advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this
advice now. Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, never mind. You will not
understand the power and beauty of your youth until they&#146;ve faded. But trust me, in
20 years, you&#146;ll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can&#146;t
grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are
not as fat as you imagine. Don&#146;t worry about the future. Or worry, but know that
worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The
real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the
kind that blinded you at 4PM on some idle Tuesday. Do one thing every day that scares you.
Sing. Don&#146;t be reckless with other people&#146;s hearts. Don&#146;t put up with
people who are reckless with yours. Floss. Don&#146;t waste your time on jealousy.
Sometimes you&#146;re ahead, sometimes you&#146;re behind. The race is long and, in the
end, it&#146;s only with yourself. Remember compliments you receive. Forget the insults.
If you succeed in doing this, tell me how. Keep your old love letters. Throw away your old
bank statements. Stretch. Don&#146;t feel guilty if you don&#146;t know what you want to
do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn&#146;t know at 22 what they
wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still
don&#146;t. Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees. You&#146;ll miss them when
they&#146;re gone. Maybe you&#146;ll marry, maybe you won&#146;t. Maybe you&#146;ll have
children, maybe you won&#146;t. Maybe you&#146;ll divorce at 40, maybe you&#146;ll dance
the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary. Whatever you do, don&#146;t
congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance.
So are everybody else&#146;s.&nbsp; Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don&#146;t
be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. It&#146;s the greatest instrument
you&#146;ll ever own. Dance. Even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room. Read
the directions, even if you don&#146;t follow them. Do not read beauty magazines. They
will only make you feel ugly. Get to know your parents. You never know when they&#146;ll
be gone for good. Be nice to your siblings. They&#146;re your best link to your past and
the people most likely to stick with you in the future. Understand that friends come and
go, but with a precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography
and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when
you were young. Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. Live in
Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft. Travel. Accept certain
inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will philander. You, too, will get old.
And when you do, you&#146;ll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable,
politicians were noble, and children respected their elders. Respect your elders.
Don&#146;t expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund. Maybe
you&#146;ll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when either one might run out.
Don&#146;t mess too much with your hair or by the time you&#146;re 40 it will look 85. Be
careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of
nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off,
painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it&#146;s worth. But trust me
on the sunscreen.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Letters to the Editor</strong></font></p>

<hr noshade color="#3D477B" size="1">

<p><font face="Arial"><small>In response to April 5th&#146;s &#147;In your face&#148;
column.</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>Dear Editor,</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>I am a non-smoker. Ever since I was little and had to endure
my mother&#146;s bad habit, I have abhorred the smell, look, and even feel of cigarettes.
(She quit while I was still very young.) I have friends who smoke, but they are, for the
most part, understanding of my feelings on the subject.</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>I do not have a problem with cigarettes and people smoking.
It&#146;s a bad habit, just like over-eating or biting your finger nails. However, this
bad habit has the potential to harm those who do not smoke. What bothers me is the
attitude of many smokers I come across. They are going to indulge themselves when they
want, where they want, with little regard for their own health or for the comfort of
others.</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>Ms. Adams stated that our society is becoming one of
&#147;paranoid tattle-tales.&#148; I think our society is becoming something far worse -
one of individualistic, self-oriented people that would rather enjoy what they are doing
than deal with the inconvenience of considering others and the health of those around
them.</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>I am fed up with the excuses. &#147;It&#146;s my car and you
didn&#146;t have to come along.&#148; &#147;It&#146;s my body, I&#146;ll do with it as I
please.&#148; &#147;It&#146;s my house, I&#146;ll stink it up if I want to.&#148;
&#147;Me! Me! Me!&#148; Aren&#146;t we as humans, and our relationships with each other,
much more important than some habit that is detrimental in the first place? Is a
twenty-minute car ride too much time to ask a person not to smoke? I don&#146;t think so.</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>I truly believe that smokers have no idea how much of an
imposition it is for non-smokers to be around them. If I go on a trip with a smoker, I
have to wash all of the clothes I took, regardless of whether or not I wore them, before I
can wear them again. The odor is that pervasive.</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>However, I am not going to disassociate myself with my
friends who smoke because I love them for who they are and, yes, we all have our faults.
However, it pains me to see them continue to bow down to this addiction day in and day
out, rearranging their lives around it, always saying &#147;I&#146;ll quit next
week.&#148;</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>Smoking is an addiction. Smoking does kill you. If you smoke
and know you need to quit, why not now? All you are doing is postponing the inevitable. It
will be just as hard then as it will be now, if not harder. You have no idea how much your
life can improve.</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>It would be my dream to live in a smoke-free society. There
would be one less thing in this world to divide and polarize us, especially in a time when
unity is so desperately needed.</small></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Registering for classes is not a new thing at Columbus
State, but how come every time registration rolls around, be it early or regular, it seems
as though the college is never prepared: teachers are not in their offices during posted
registration hours and the computers always seem to be down. I pay enough in tuition that
they could get someone to fix the computer problem. Someone is not doing their job. I seem
to remember celebrating CSU&#146;s 40th anniversary. Isn&#146;t 40 years long enough to
work out the problems with registration? I&#146;ve recently heard talk of students being
able to register online themselves. While I am looking forward to this convenient
advancement, I wonder what new problem this well cause. Come on guys, let&#146;s try to
fix this before another 40 years goes by CSU, get a clue!</font></p>

</font><font size="1">by Wes Carroll / Guest Writer</font></strong></font></p>

<hr noshade color="#3D477B" size="1">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you&#146;re anything like me, you aren&#146;t impressed
with the mainstream, at least not when it comes to movies. I mean, who cares about big
budget movies from big budget studios with big budget actors and big budget directors and
big budget budgets?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&#147;A lot of people,&#148; you might answer. &#147;A lot
of shallow people with no depth,&#148; I might retort. &#147;Just because people go see
Keanu Reeves&#146; movies like &#147;The Matrix&#148; (now in theaters) doesn&#146;t mean
that they don&#146;t have depth,&#148; you might then say. To which I would reply,
&#147;What the hell does &#145;retort&#146; mean, anyway?&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">So, to avoid this ugly scenario, let me tell you about a
nice little underground movie that I heard about from my sources up in Atlanta.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">First of all, it&#146;s not a foreign film. I know that
people tend to think labeling a film &#147;foreign&#148; makes it &#147;deep.&#148; Well,
this is not always true.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Take, for example, the Roberto &#147;Bob&#148; Benigni film
&#147;La Vita e Bella (Life is Beautiful)&#148;. That movie was certainly foreign, but in
a bad way with all the subtitles and silly accents. On the other extreme, you find really
great foreign films like &#147;Young Einstein&#148; with the internationally famous Yahoo
&#147;Bob&#148; Serious. You didn&#146;t see him at the Oscars making a fool of himself.
In fact, he wasn&#146;t even at the Oscars. Now that&#146;s hardcore.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Then there&#146;s arguably the greatest foreign film of all
time, &#147;European Vacation&#148; starring Chevy Chase. Now that&#146;s a great foreign
film. But this underground film I&#146;m here to tell you about is not foreign at all, but
hopefully be every bit as deep. So here goes:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Apparently (and this comes from a close source I trust)
they are making a new...get this...&#148;Star Wars&#148; movie. In case you missed them,
the &#147;Star Wars&#148; movies were from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. They
were a cult hit and I&#146;m just glad that everyone didn&#146;t see them or else that
would&#146;ve ruined a good thing. So anyway, my source tells me that this new movie (to
be called &#147;The Phantom Menace&#148;) will be a pre-quel (literally &#145;before
quel&#146;) to the first &#147;Star Wars&#148;.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, it&#146;s such an underground movie, I fear that it
may not come to Columbus at all. So, I&#146;m campaigning hard to make sure that it gets
released here. And you can help by writing to Carmike Cinemas and demanding that they show
it. We have a right to see it. And I promise you that I won&#146;t sleep until I know for
sure that it will be shown in Columbus. Now I gotta go- &#147;The Matrix&#148; starts in
20 minutes.</font></p>
