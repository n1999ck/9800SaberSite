<hr size="1" noshade color="#0066FF">

<p>Columbus State University has named Shawn Cruzen, assistant
professor of astronomy, as Educator of the Year. The announcement
highlighted the April 30 Scholastic Honors Convocation in Fine
Arts Hall. Other top honorees included Bill Chappell (Faculty
Service Award), Mary Lindquist (Faculty Research and Scholarship
Award), student Anna Mion (Faculty Cup) and Emily Nerness (Phi
Kappa Phi and Academic Recognition Awards). </p>

<p>In addition to teaching physics, Cruzen directs the Mead
Observatory at CSU&#146;s Coca-Cola Space Science Center. He
joined the CSU faculty in 1997, and has published three papers,
one investigating the nature of active galaxies and two
describing a sample of galaxies found within a giant void. He is
currently working on another paper describing these void
galaxies.</p>

<p>Primarily through the space science center, Cruzen&#146;s
community involvement has included directing astronomy workshops
for teachers, quarterly public seminars on astronomy, distance
learning projects using the GSAMS (Georgia Statewide Academic and
Medical System) network and developing summer camps in space
sciences. He holds a philosophy doctorate in Physics from the
University of Nevada-Las Vegas.</p>

<p>Chappell, a CSU faculty member since 1976, serves as associate
dean of the College of Arts and Letters and professor of
Political Science. He is recognized for leading the development
of CSU&#146;s Master of Public Administration program as the
program&#146;s former director. He is also widely perceived as a
mentor to faculty and department chairpersons, and his service on
prominent campus committees is extensive. A university liaison to
the community, his expertise has been consistently sought by
off-campus organizations including the news media.</p>

<p>Lindquist is the Fuller E. Callaway Professor of Mathematics
Education in CSU&#146;s College of Education. Since joining CSU
in 1984, she has authored or co-authored 19 books or monographs,
written 17 chapters, published 22 professional papers and has
made several presentations at national and international
conferences. She also has been awarded approximately $1.7 million
in research grants. She holds a doctorate in Mathematics
Education from the University of Wisconsin.</p>

<p>In receiving the Faculty Cup, Anna Mion earned the highest
CSU-student honor, signifying superior academic achievement,
participation in university organizations, leadership and
service.</p>

<p>Also honored as the outstanding 1998-99 history major, Mion
(3.97 GPA) received less than an A-grade only once (a &#147;B&#148;)
in four years of CSU course work. Other academic achievements
include Phi Kappa Phi induction (spring &#145;98), Board of
Regents Study Abroad Scholarship (France) recipient (summer
&#145;97), Dean&#146;s list 1995-99, Outstanding Junior History
Major (spring &#145;98), and she represented CSU as a Hope
Scholar for the University System&#146;s Appreciation Banquet for
Governor Zell Miller.</p>

<p>Communication major Emily Nerness (4.0 GPA) received the
Academic Recognition and Phi Kappa Phi Senior awards. Previous
honors include the WRBL Communication Scholarship (1997 and 1999)
and a listing in Who&#146;s Who Among Students in American
Colleges and Universities. She is president of the CSU
Communication Club and a member of Phi Kappa Phi.</p>

<p>A new cultural activity for students has arrived on campus.
The new Studio Theatre group will provide students with the
opportunity to produce plays that cannot be produced by the
theater department. </p>

<p>According to Molly Henderson, the managing director, the group&#146;s
mission is to, &#147;Challenge student views on the world around
them, broaden students prospects on what theater is and how it
can be produced, and present works by contemporary playwrights
and students.&#147;</p>

<p>This organization will be able to produce plays that may be
too controversial for the school to endorse, but will still be of
benefit to the student body. </p>

<p>The group has access to any theater space on campus and will
also produce outdoor plays. Tickets will range from $5-$8 so that
shows will be cheap enough for all to enjoy. </p>

<p>The organization was around in the early 1980s and has been
revived by Gerald Gibson, the artistic director. This is an
opportunity for students with busy schedules to participate in
theatre and learn about production. </p>

<p>It is the hope of the founders that this group will offer an
outlet for not only theatre majors, but for those who have not
chosen theatre as their course of study as well. In this way,
they plan to include people from all aspects of life here at CSU.
</p>

<p>Any student who has a play idea, wants to act, or has written
a play and wants it produced can e-mail
Studio-Theatre@excite.com. </p>

<p>Last week, the Columbus Room was filled with faculty and
students eager to learn about the situation in Kosovo. </p>

<p>Victor Neumann, who teaches history at a Romanian university,
gave a lecture on the history of the Balkans to help others
understand why the killings are happening in that area. </p>

<p>He explained that the Serbian region is filled with a mixture
of languages, religions, and cultures. This area has a long
history of land disputes, so military action, in Neumann&#146;s
opinion, is pointless. </p>

<p>This received a strong reaction from the military students who
wanted to know how he would solve the situation without the
presence of ground troops. Mr. Neumann responded by saying he
agreed with the Austrian solution, but did not give details. </p>

<p>Several other topics were discussed, including the issue of
education in Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>Several groups sponsored the lecture, including the Office of
International and Multicultural Affairs. Photographers and the
news media were also present. </p>

Colorado tragedy<br>
</strong></font><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Clarissa
Andrews / Staff Writer</strong></font></p>

<hr size="1" noshade color="#0066FF">

<p>Just before noon on Tuesday, April 20, two students from the
&#147;Trenchcoat Mafia&#148; at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colorado, began an attack that left fifteen dead,
including themselves. By now, everyone has seen the reports of
the sawed-off shotguns, pipe bombs, and the many other weapons
used in this killing spree. Across the country, students and
parents are terrified at the idea of the same thing happening in
their towns. Everyone is asking, &#147;What could have caused
those young men to kill thirteen innocent people?&#148; The
students at CSU are no exception.</p>

<p>Jean Landreau says, &#147;People are wanting to place blame
for this incident. Perhaps some of them should look inward.&#148;
Although Landreau does not condone the activities of Eric Harris
and Dylan Klebold, she says they were &#147;certainly exhibiting
signs of anger long before this tragedy. The wearing of Nazi
insignia and uniforms, speaking German, and the Nazi salutes were
attempts to get attention... the ultimate attention-getter for
these two became a notoriety worthy only of the likes of their
idol, Adolf Hitler.&#148;</p>

<p>Another student, Jason Ezzell, feels that the events in
Littleton prove &#147;a couple of things. Guns should be a more
regulated item and schools should take more safety precautions
than they do now.&#148; Ezzell recalled that, during his years at
Pacelli High School, many of the outer doors were locked, which
meant students had to walk around the building to enter if they
got locked out. While some students complained about this, Ezzell
says that &#147;it&#146;s better than letting a crazed maniac
with a gun walk into the hallway.&#148;</p>

<p>One of the many explanations offered for the killings has been
the music the killers listened to-bands such as Marilyn Manson
and KMFDM. Adam Brown says that rather than blame the music,
people should blame the availability of guns. Many people are
angry with the NRA who scheduled a conference in Denver for just
a few days after the shootings, and then refused to cancel.
Instead, they have agreed to limit it to one day.</p>

<p>According to Brown, &#147;The NRA should be shut down, and the
guns should be stored in arsenals somewhere. The Constitution
gives us the right to bear arms, but that was when American soil
was infiltrated by the enemy. If that happened again, the
military could open its arsenals and we could &#145;bear arms&#146;
once more. Until then, there is no reason for us to own
semi-automatic weapons. It&#146;s outrageous that anyone can get
hold of a TEC 9 semi-automatic, much less a minor without his
parents knowing about it.&#148;</p>

<p>MerriAnne McCall says that it is &#147;amazing to me what some
young people are capable of. I don&#146;t understand what
circumstances could make them have that much hatred.&#148;</p>

<p>Landreau doesn&#146;t understand either, but says that &#147;one
has to wonder if these young men had received some of the
attention they craved, even being told that their behavior was
unacceptable, maybe things would have been very different. There
is a lesson to be learned from this tragedy for everyone.&#148;</p>

<p>No one will forget the tragedy that took place in Littleton,
Colorado, nor will anyone ever be able to give definite answers
to the many questions being asked all over the United States.
Will people continue blaming Marilyn Manson&#146;s music,
especially now that he has cancelled the rest of his tour out of
respect to the victims? Will people blame the availability of
weapons on the NRA? Or will the blame be placed on the internet,
the boys&#146; parents, cliques in high school, or the thousands
of other reasons the young men had for killing thirteen people?
Did Klebold and Harris have help making and placing the thirty
bombs found around the school? These are questions everyone wants
answered...</p>

<p>Whatever the answers may be, the one resoundingly unanimous
opinion is that this tragedy is one of the worst this nation has
ever experienced.</p>

<p>Well, finals week has arrived. I didn&#146;t think it would
ever get here. Finals week is comparatively relaxing for me,
since most of my big assignments are usually due the preceding
week. </p>

<p>This is the end of my first year at CSU, and it seems like
just yesterday I was unloading my car at Courtyard II in the
sweltering heat of August. My parents say that time seems to move
faster the older you get, but if the world starts spinning any
faster, I think I might fly off into space. </p>

<p>Anyway, since this is my last column of the year, I thought I
would ramble on about the assorted things I have experienced this
year. All in all, I think my experiences at CSU have turned me
into a more virtuous person. Let me explain.</p>

<p>First of all, I have lived in the dorms, surrounded by lots of
people who apparently do not sleep. That&#146;s fine with me,
until they start assuming that I don&#146;t sleep either. My
telephone rang five times last night between midnight and two in
the morning. Don&#146;t normal people sleep then? To my credit, I
didn&#146;t say any bad words, not even the fifth time I had to
repeat, &#147;No, she&#146;s still not here.&#148; It&#146;s
okay, though, because I am learning patience.</p>

<p>Next, since I live in Courtyard, I am required to buy a meal
plan. For those of you unfamiliar with the dorms, we do have
fully equipped kitchens, and some of us can even cook. But no, we
have to shell out $730 bucks a semester for food that isn&#146;t
very good or very healthy. I have to give thumbs up to the
lunchroom staff, however, because they are always polite and
helpful. A few days ago, one of the serving ladies even agreed
with me when I said the food looked disgusting. The cafeteria
food is okay, though, because it is teaching me the holy practice
of fasting.</p>

<p>This past week, I was sitting in class in Howard Hall, when a
loud, car-alarm type noise began blasting throughout the
building. Well, my classmates and I looked at each other,
wondering, is it a fire alarm? Or a severe weather alert? Should
we disturb our deep contemplation of poetry for this? Finally, we
got up and followed our professor outside like a row of little
ducklings. It was really a false fire alarm, but what if it had
been a tornado alert? Do you really want to file out of the
building in an orderly fashion if a tornado is coming? Or do you
want to &#147;duck and cover&#148; if a fire from the Healthy
Choice Deli is raging through the building? So, when faced with
such uncertainties here at CSU, I have learned, as the good book
says, to pray without ceasing.</p>

<p>And last of all, I hope everyone has enjoyed the random
thoughts that have emerged from &#147;within my room&#148; this
semester. I have certainly enjoyed composing them for you to
read. Every week I have searched diligently (and sometimes
painfully) for a topic to entertain, and maybe even enlighten
you, and that has taught me perseverance. So, from your devoted
columnist, best of luck during finals week - both for the
students who have to take tests, and for the professors who have
to grade them! I&#146;m sure that, like me, your exertions will
bring you closer to virtue, or at least closer to graduation! </p>

<p>Well, here we are at the end of the academic year and
beginning of that long-awaited summer break! Some of our number
will be heading home, while others buckle down to &#147;blitz&#148;
courses, cramming a semester&#146;s worth of study into one or
two weeks. Many others, year-round members of the campus
community, will continue in their routine work pattern.
Unfortunately, this last group includes Sneaky Sam and his
cohorts, the thieves and vandals who prey on all the other
groups.</p>

<p>Sam and his pals will continue to steal bookbags (unless YOU
keep them under your physical control), continue to rob and
assault folks (unless YOU take the proper precautions, travel in
groups, etc.), and continue to steal university and personal
property which isn&#146;t safe-guarded (unless YOU take the time
to secure desks, rooms, labs, and offices). Sam knows there will
befewer people on campus for the next couple of months, which
means fewer witnesses and less likelihood of getting caught in
his nefarious activities.</p>

<p>Sooooo, let&#146;s all keep our eyes open especially wide and
help put Sneaky Sam and his partners on notice that everyone is
playing their part in crime prevention and detection, not merely
coasting through the summer period as blissful victims-to-be.
Watch YOUR property and vehicle; be responsible for YOUR living
area and workspace; guard YOUR neighborhood against strangers and
suspicious persons; and, above all, protect YOURSELF by
exercising caution and restraint in your summertime activities.</p>

<p>If you do these things, either here in the University
community or at home in your own neighborhood, it will make for a
safe and pleasant summer. The officers of Public Safety will
always be there for you, but we can&#146;t be everywhere at once,
so please take care and help us help you by following these
common sense guidelines.</p>

<p>Have a wonderful time and come back safe and sound in the
Fall. Or, for you graduates, congratulations, and good luck in
whatever endeavor you choose to pursue.</p>

<p>Another semester gone... another grade earned. Am I glad that
summer is here? Oh yeah!!!! It is time to let your hair down and
bask in the glow of summer laziness. Time for pool parties and
tan bodies, vacations and sleeping late, and a time for summer
love to sizzle under the hot Georgia sun.</p>

<p>This semester has been wonderful. I have enjoyed writing this
column and seeing how it has affected the student body. Thank you

students; of course they will be full of my usual sassy attitude.</p>

<p>Tell me what you want to know, CSU, and I will dig up some
dirt for you. For now, let us all concentrate on days filled with
soap operas, golf outings, skiing, and of course, looking for
those hot bodies on the beach. Go out and have some fun, but be
careful and safe. Let&#146;s try and cut down on the DUI&#146;s
and STD&#146;s. I have already told ya&#146;ll that condoms are

<p>Dear Editor,</p>

<p>I would like to discuss an issue that should be important to
all of us - the doctors at the health clinic. Recently I became
sick and had to visit the health clinic. I saw Dr. Lewis and
after about a two minute exam he prescribed medicine for me and
sent me on my merry way. Two days later I was back in the doctor&#146;s
office feeling worse than before. This time I saw Dr. Sexton.
Again after a two minute exam, I received my medication and left.
Now one week later, having gotten progressively worse, I visited
Dr. Sexton again. After describing my symptoms and again taking
two minutes to exam me, he decided I had allergies and gave me
medicine. This time I was not convinced. I know I had symptoms
that did not go along with allergies - mainly chills and body
aches. So I drove to my parents house, 1 1/2 hours from Columbus,
to see my family doctor. After a very thorough examination, my
doctor diagnosed me with the flu and said I was very contagious.
The flu is a very recognizable ailment and one that any qualified
doctor should be able to recognize. I&#146;m sure our doctors are
good physicians, but they do not take enough time. They rush
through the examination, listen to your symptoms, and within five
minutes you are done. These doctors do not know us. They cannot
decide what we have that quickly. I say we deserve the best care
possible. If these doctors are not willing to take some time with
their patients, then let&#146;s get some new ones!!</p>

<p>CSU Student</p>

<p>Where did this term, &#145;college idiots&#146; come from? It
came, as a result of people getting a college degree and even a
master&#146;s degree, and still not knowing much about the field
they majored in. This result comes from several reasons. </p>

<p>First of all, it comes from too much cramming for tests so you
can try and make a passing grade. Then it is so much material
that even if you&#146;re fortunate enough to pass the test, you&#146;re
surely not going to retain it. I&#146;m talking three to six
chapter tests. I mean, get real! If a person is lucky enough to
graduate, they&#146;re only going to retain approximately ten
percent of the material or even less than that.</p>

<p>The solution? Teachers, and the Board of Regents need to wake
up and give a two chapter test bi-weekly, discuss former chapters
along with latter chapters and then give a general comprehensive
final test on the most important points. This is the one and only
solution to the problem. And, until this problem is dealt with
properly, it will continue to exist and plague our future
graduates. I, for one, think this is a very serious problem, not
to be taken lightly. I know, if I was a teacher, I would hate to
be partly responsible for graduating a &#145;college idiot&#146;.</p>

<p>I, as a student am very concerned about all this cramming. I&#146;m
not talking about waiting until the last minute to study, but I&#146;m
referring to cramming three to six chapters into one test. That&#146;s,
on the average, only about five-hundred pages one is required to
remember, just to get a good grade on the test. I really hope
this gets published and, further, yet, I pray that every teacher
will take a copy of this to their meeting with the Board of
Regents. You know, I really would hate to be classified, after
finishing college, with a statement like &#147;Oh well; just
another &#145;college idiot&#146;.&#148;</p>

<p>8 Ways To Get Out Of Going To Work This Week</p>

<p>1) &#147;When I got up this morning, I took two Ex-Lax in
addition to my Prozac. I can&#146;t get off the john, but I feel
good about it.&#148;</p>

<p>2) &#147;I set half the clocks in my house ahead an hour and
the other half back an hour Saturday and spent 18 hours in some
kind of space-time continuum loop, re-living Sunday (right up
until the explosion). I was able to exit the loop only by
reversing the polarity of the power source of exactly [e*log(pi)]
clocks in the house while simultaneously rapping my dog on the
snout with a rolled up Times. Accordingly, I will be in late, or
early.&#148;</p>

<p>3) &#147;I am stuck in the blood pressure machine down at
Publix.&#148;</p>

<p>4) &#147;Constipation has made me a walking time bomb.&#148;</p>

<p>5) &#147;I just found out that I was switched at birth.
Legally, I shouldn&#146;t come to work knowing my employee
records may now contain false information.&#148;</p>

<p>6) &#147;I&#146;m feeling a little disgruntled this morning.
You think I should come in?&#148;</p>

<p>7) &#147;I refuse to travel to my job in the District until
there is a commuter tax. I insist on paying my fair share.&#148;</p>

<p>8) &#147;I&#146;ve used up all my sick days... so I&#146;m
calling in dead!&#148;</p>

<hr size="1" noshade color="#0066FF">

<p>Well, it&#146;s happened again. A pair of upper-middle class
high school kids in a small &#147;close-knit&#148; town have
decided that their peers didn&#146;t treat them with respect so
they decided to get together a giant pile of automatic weapons
and grenades and head to school seeking revenge. And once again,
America is forced to ask the question, &#147;Why?&#148;</p>

<p>Well, I have my theories about why this is happening and I
just want to get them out there in the open. The sooner we
understand why this is happening, the sooner we can do something
about it. There are four basic causes for this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Cause number one is movies set in the old west. Now I know
that you are thinking, &#147;Huh?&#148; and I understand that,
but hear me out. Think about the plot of every Western ever
filmed. A guy or group of guys who are normally peaceful are
provoked by some bad guys who inevitably kill or kidnap someone
very close to the &#147;good guy&#148;. This may be his mom,
daughter, sister, son, wife, girlfriend, sister-in-law, best pal,
dog, the town sheriff, the town deputy, the town drunk (Otis), or
worst of all, his horse. This causes a complete rage to overtake
our pacifist hero and he gets together a posse and they go out
and kill all the bad guys for the pure satisfaction of revenge.</p>

<p>Next we can blame rap music. Now I know that rap music gets
blamed for everything that goes wrong. But I think it definitely
deserves a slice of this blame pie. Where else is this gang-type,
mafia-style union glorified but in Westerns and rap music? It&#146;s
all about who you &#147;hang with&#148; and &#147;who&#146;s got
your back.&#148;</p>

<p>Next, we blame Marilyn Manson. These kids from Colorado (the
Trench-coat Mafia) looked up to Manson and, let&#146;s be
realistic here for a second, the guy is evil. Okay? I know that
people like his &#147;music&#148; and think he&#146;s
misunderstood, but in the midst of what is going on in America,
let&#146;s just see him, for a minute, as he is: EVIL. There. </p>

<p>Lastly, I blame Keanu Reeves. These kids really looked up to
Reeves&#146; character in &#147;The Matrix&#148; (now in
theaters) and wanted to be like him when they dressed in black
and shot everyone. So, he must be evil, too. That would explain
his success as an actor despite the handicap of not having any
acting ability whatsoever.</p>

<p>So, what do we do about this? Simple. We send, Keanu Reeves
and Marilyn Manson to Iraq. While the Iraqis try to figure out
what Manson is, Keanu can peacefully lull them to sleep with a
scene from any of his movies. Thus, less hostility.</p>

<p>Next, we send all the rappers to Kosovo and let them handle
things there. And Puff Daddy can beat Slobodan like he was a
record executive. Problem solved. No more &#147;heroes&#148; for
the high school kids and no more wars in Europe and the Middle
East.</p>

<p>Of course, maybe I&#146;m wrong. Maybe I just don&#146;t like
rap music, Westerns, Marilyn Manson, or Keanu Reeves.</p>

<p>First off, wrestling fans received sad news two weeks ago.
&#147;Ravishing&#148; Rick Rude passed away earlier this month,
and the cause of death appears to be a heart attack. Rude was
best known for his stint in the WWF where he defeated The
Ultimate Warrior for the Intercontinental Championship. Rude also
had a reign in WCW as the International Champion - a title
formerly known as the NWA World title. His last role in wrestling
was as a manager for longtime friend Curt Henning. </p>

<p>R.I.P. Rick Rude 1958-1999. Rude was rumored to be looking for
a return to active wrestling with his former employer, the WWF. </p>

<p>It is rumored that Scott Hall was ready to make his comeback
last Monday night. However, friend and booker Kevin Nash decided
to hold off Hall&#146;s return for a little while longer, because
Hall&#146;s return right now will not fit into the storyline
leading up to this next pay-per-view fight. When Hall does return
he will be working Pay Per View and Monday Nitro shows only. Hall&#146;s
working agreement with WCW has him off for all house shows. Hall
recently got back together with his wife Dana and he is putting
family before wrestling. Good for you Scott Hall.</p>

<p>Word on the net is that Triple H is expressing his
disagreement in the way the WWF has been using him lately. HHH
was against the heel turn when the idea was first presented to
him. HHH wants DX to stay around and he might be pushing for the
WWF to form a heel DX group that will be allied with the
Corporation and will feud with the face DX group. Sound familiar?
Remember WCW had the NWO split and feud last year? Well, it was a
good story then, and I guess the revamped version will be ok too.</p>

<p>There is not much happening in wrestling right now that is all
that exciting. Expect Kevin Nash to destroy DDP for the title at
the next Pay-Per-View fight. Degeneration X should be hot in the
WWF for awhile. The Hardy Boyz, Shawn Michaels, and maybe even
Test or Val Venis may get involved with DX. The Austin/ McMahon
being friends angle is interesting. WCW should be following the
same trend, and in the near future new friendships and stables
should be formed, probably involving Randy Savage, DDp, Nash,
Scott Hall, Sting, Ric Flair and Goldberg as the centerpieces.</p>

<p>Let me tack this on the the end of this spill of useless
&#145;wrasllin&#146; information... Several weeks ago I did one
of the most retarded things I have ever. I did this with a friend
of mine, Brennen Knight. We drove into the middle of Nowhere,
Georgia and trained to be professional wrestlers.</p>

<p>Well, I trained once. Brennen has been back and is aiming to
start working in the ring sometime around June. I, on the other
hand still have trouble typing, walking and thinking straight
because I tried to &#147;wrestle&#148; a guy named RazorBlade. I
put &#147;wrestle&#148; in quotes because it has an alternative
definition when it applies to that particular day in the ring.
(see bottom for alternative definition ). Check this out ... the
ring is in the guy&#146;s back yard, and is made out of plywood
and hose pipe for ring ropes. Talk about hardcore wrestling. I
learned my lesson ... I love wrestling, and I now have the
highest level of respect for those guys. The matches might be
staged, and the outcome is predetermined, but it is very very
real. Good luck Brennen.</p>

<p>Recently I had the pleasure of going to see the John Scott
Evans Band play. I actually had a few friends introduce me to the
band, and to be honest I was a little hesitant at first. Like
most of us uncultured Columbus folk, I&#146;ve never really been
a big fan of music without words. But after hearing what most
patrons of our local music scene have already experienced, I was
amazed. Better yet, I was blown away.</p>

<p>I was so impressed in fact, that I wanted to share a little
about the band with our readers. The John Scott Evans band has an
interesting array of musicians and an even more interesting array
of instruments. The bands&#146; members are: Raymond J. Blair on
bass, David Ragsdale (former Kansas member) plays violin, Chris
McGriff adds a nice touch on the keyboard, Dave Holland rocks on
percussion, John T. David (newest member of the band) plays
drums, and John Scott Evans brings it all together with his lead
guitar.</p>

<p>The band manages to use their array of instruments and musical
talent to create a truly unique sound. John Evans put it nicely
when he described his music as &#147;Gypsy-Jazz-Flemenco-Pop.&#148;
But when you&#146;re captivated by the funky-trance-jazzadelic
sound, categorizing the music is the last thing on your mind. You
might just have to listen for yourself. After the show try to
create a new &#147;description&#148; for all of us uncultured
Columbus natives. JSE is scheduled to perform May 22 at the Loft
at 9 p.m.</p>

<p>If you like what you hear, be sure to grab one of the CDs
available after most of the bands gigs. The CD, recorded in 1997,
will give you some good groovy tunes to blast out of your car
this summer at the beach. Also, be on the lookout for a new CD by
JSE on the way soon.</p>

Jefferson Davis<br>
</strong></font><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>The
Brothers of Kappa Sigma</strong></font></p>

<hr size="1" noshade color="#0066FF">

<p>Kappa Sigma brothers, nationwide, recently remembered
Jefferson Day, named in honor of Jefferson Davis, the only
honorary initiate of Kappa Sigma. The story of Davis&#146;
initiation actually starts with Jefferson Davis Jr. Davis Jr. was
one of the first initiates of an early chapter at the Virginia
Military Institute. During Davis Jr.&#146;s short life, he
exemplified everything that the Order stood for then and
continues to strive towards today.</p>

<p>The story has been documented as follows. When the chapter, to
which Davis Jr. belonged, contracted yellow fever, the young man
refused to seek safety. Instead, Davis Jr. stayed behind to tend
to the sick and attempt to nurse his brothers in their time of
need. Sadly, Davis Jr. was also claimed by the deadly plague and
passed away. This act has often been described as one of the
greatest examples of fraternal love in the history of Kappa
Sigma.</p>

<p>So moved was the father, Jefferson Davis Sr., that he
developed a close affiliation with Kappa Sigma and soon came to
love it as his son had before him. Davis often proudly displayed
the emblems of the Order, bearing to all his pride in his son. In
fact, Davis was instrumental in the founding of Omega Chapter in
the formative years of the fraternity. And so, because of his son&#146;s
devotion, and the contributions which he made in the name of the
Order, Jefferson Davis Sr. was duly initiated into the Kappa
Sigma Fraternity MCMLXII.</p>

<p>And so, we as Kappa Sigmas still pay homage to the devotion of
the son and the father. &#147;Greater love hath no man.&#148;

<hr size="1" noshade color="#0066FF">

<p>The brothers of Tau Kappa Epsilon would like to welcome its
newest members during the 1998-99 academic year. Fall semester
concluded with the initiation of Drew Ayers, Ricky Dumlao, and
David Dale. During the spring semester, TKE decided to have two
periods of rush and two candidate periods. The first half of the
semester,TKE welcomed Brandon Myers, Chris Rayner, and Dennis
McAbee into the brotherhood. After Spring Break, the second rush
period began in which Rob Piller received a bid and is currently
going through his candidate period.</p>

<p>The Omicron - Tau Chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon is very proud
of these men and their leadership abilities. Ricky Dumlao is
currently TKE&#146;s representative to Greek Council and plans to
run for a position on executive council. Brandon Myers has taken
on the responsibility of Fundraiser Chair for TKE, a job which
entails the planing and organizing of fundraising events for the
fraternity. Chris Rayner was appointed to the position of Rush
Chair, and is responsible for planing and executing rush events
for the fall semester. Dennis McAbeeholds the position of
Athletic Chair, and is charge of intramural sports on campus. Rob
Piller, so far, has made excellent progress through his candidate
period and TKE expects great things from him as well.</p>

<p>Tau Kappa Epsilon would like to congratulate all these men for
their accomplishments this year. They have worked hard and proven
their ability to accept the challenge and take charge in
difficult situations. They are truly an asset to TKE and Greek
Life on campus. Great things are expected of them in the future.</p>
