</font><font size="1">Athena Curry / Editor-in-Chief</font></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The fifth annual Spring Break Celebration kicks off next
week, April 12-18. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The celebration, sponsored by the Columbus State University
Alumni Association, raises money for CSU scholarships and faculty and staff development.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The celebration will have a new addition this year, the
&#147;Festival of Southern Culture&#148;. This new feature will include dance, food, arts
and crafts and music that reflect southern culture. The &#147;Festival of Southern
Culture&#148; will be held on Saturday and Sunday and a mini-version will be held on
Friday. Area schools will be invited to Friday&#146;s event.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Spring Break Celebration will also include all the old
favorites, 30 rides including the Ferris wheel, live entertainment and carnival style
food. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">CSU students with identification are admitted to the
celebration free. Regular admission for adults is $5.00, children 12-18 is $2.00, and
children under 12 are admitted free with tickets from Burger King. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><font size="3">Davidson Center undergoes renovation<br>
</font><font size="1">Helen Godwin / Associate Editor</font></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Columbus State University&#146;s Davidson Center will soon
have a brand new facade.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Currently, the area across from the Student Health Center
is being renovated to make room for a mini post office area. It will house mailboxes for
the students living in campus housing and will be available for other students to use.
There will also be a stamp machine and mailbox in this area.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">At this time campus mail is only delivered to one spot on
campus. Student assistance must distribute the mail around campus, including campus
housing. The mini post office will eliminate this extra burden on student assistants. Mail
will be delivered to the boxes once a day and at that time the stamp machine will be
checked and the mailbox will be emptied.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">According to Mr. Pattillo, Vice President of Finance,
another renovation that is tentatively scheduled to start during the Christmas holidays of
1999 is a completely new look for the cafeteria and surrounding areas.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Public Safety will move into the P.E. Annex and that area
will become a cash and carry section like what is currently available in the cafeteria.
The current cafeteria area will become an all-you-can-eat dining area for students with a
meal plan. This service is not currently offered because the way that the dining area is
set up, there is no controlled access that can be monitored by the staff.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This $1 million dollar renovation will also include making
the bathrooms handicap accessible, renovating the entrance, and several other changes.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Board of Regents is considering what funding will be
available for this project, which will happen as soon as CSU re-bids their food service
contract. This has not been done for seven years, so Aramark and other food services will
soon be submitting proposals for review. </font></p>

</font><font size="1">Athena Curry / Editor-in-Chief</font></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Kalisa Roger Remera will address &#147;Rwandan Genocide and
U.S./Africa policy in the 21st Century&#148; 12 p.m. Monday, April 12 in the Columbus
Room. The lecture is free and open to the public. Remera will be joined by
African-activist colleagues Bakary Tandia (human rights/contemporary slavery) and
signer/songwriter Rebecca Wakuteka.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Presently a Rastafarian pacifist, Remera works to promote
peace in Rwanda and awareness outside the borders. An attack left Remera wounded and his
entire family killed during his homeland&#146;s 1994 genocide. He dramatically underlines
the importance for U.S. citizens to understand their government&#146;s policies and their
impact on ordinary citizens. He also warns of the &#147;deadly&#148; consequences from
government-sanctioned arms trading.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Tandia, exiled from Mauritania, lobbied UN missions, the
U.S. State Department and European governments in pressuring the Mauritania government to
free imprisoned, anti-slavery leader Boubcar Messaoud. He has been a leading activist
against his homeland&#146;s oppressive government.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Wakuteka, a native of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
lives in Amsterdam and performs throughout Europe. Her politically-charged songs address
the fighting, fear and tension endured by Central Africans.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The event is sponsored by CSU&#146;s Center for
International Education, the Student Government Association and the American Friends
Service Committee - an international, Philadelphia-based organization promoting justice
and peace.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><font size="3">Visiting students return to help others<br>
</font><font size="1">Athena Curry / Editor-in-Chief</font></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A group of students is in town from St. Peter,
Minnesota&#146;s Gustavus Adolphus College to do volunteer work with Habitat for Humanity.
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The students are spending their spring break helping the
organization build houses for those in need. Habitat&#146;s goal is to provide simple,
decent, affordable housing through volunteer work.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Last year, students from the same college came to CSU on a
similar mission. While here their campus was hit by a tornado, destroying many of their
dorms and classrooms. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The students stayed to finish the project and CSU gave them
use of the Courtyard II dorms, which were being remodeled at the time, while they were
here. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Many local businesses and organizations, Outdoor World,
K-Mart, Williams Hair Salon, Toms Coke/Pepsi, Bookstore, Hollywood Connection, Health
Clinic, Dental Hygiene, Student Government Association and other anonymous contributors
helped students through donations.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This semester, the Student Government Association executive
council is recommending to the forum that CSU adopts Gustavus Adolphus College as a sister
school. The council hopes to begin an exchange program with the school in which students
from CSU and students from Gustavus Adolphus visit each other&#146;s campuses. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Brown says adopting the school is definitely a
consideration and he encourages the idea.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><font size="3">Threat of war prompts opinion on campus<br>
</font><font size="1">Clarissa Andrews / Staff Writer</font></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">By this point in time, almost everyone knows something
about what is going on in Yugoslavia, even if it&#146;s just that NATO forces initiated a
large air strike last week. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Even students who rarely watch the news or read newspapers
know a few details about the situation. While students might not have cared about what was
happening on the other side of the world a month ago, the possibility of going to war has
stirred up some opinions.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Like many students, Brent Lindley, has mixed emotions:
&#147;The United States has money, so I believe we should help the people over there. But
I think we could help in other ways-it&#146;s not necessary to risk American lives.&#148;
One way Lindley feels this could be done is by sending forces to train the Kosovars to
fight for themselves. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Many Americans are comparing Slobodan Milosevic to Adolph
Hitler, but Lindley says that everyone should have a chance. He believes it is unfair to
make assumptions as to what Milosevic will do in the future. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dusty Holcomb, on the other hand, is in complete support of
the American army&#146;s involvement in Kosovo. He says people have forgotten about World
War II. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&#147;Preventive action is a wise choice. I don&#146;t want
my kids to have to read about another Holocaust,&#148; Holcomb says. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Another CSU student, who prefers to remain anonymous
states, &#147;I read somewhere that there aren&#146;t enough American ground forces to
stand man-to-man against the Serbs. If they impose the draft, I&#146;m moving to
Canada.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are people around campus, however, who are taking the
matter as seriously as it should be taken. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Mion, political science professor, says, &#147;I have
no problem with the comparison of Milosevic to Hitler.&#148; He says Milosevic is an
evil-minded man, but objects to the idea that he is &#147;crazy.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">According to Dr. Mion, Milosevic is very rational. &#147;He
wants Kosovo, whatever the price-if it means slaughtering Kosovars and Albanians, he
doesn&#146;t care,&#148; Dr. Mion says.<br>
Dr. Mion says the most difficult question about the situation is whether Americans should
actually be involved. &#147;I like to call it a lose-lose situation. The military cannot
be a solution to political problems.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Either way one looks at it, American involvement causes
conflicting feelings. People are being pushed out of Albania, and there is much suffering,
says Dr. Mion. Yet that doesn&#146;t answer the question of national interest; namely, is
it the United States&#146; interest to fight the Serbs? Should American forces go into
Yugoslavia to help save lives and risk their own lives in the process? People are not in
favor of this idea, but they don&#146;t want to hear accusations at a later point of
simply letting in happen.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Mion claims that his classes are divided on the
subject, but feel the United States should be cautious. Few people are saying,
&#147;Let&#146;s move in with ground troops,&#148; but the bombing doesn&#146;t bother
people as much if the pilots come back safely. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&#147;Yugoslavia is a sovereign country,&#148; says Dr.
Mion. &#147;Bringing in ground troops will harden the opposition against us.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Students should be more interested in what is going on
around them, according to Dr. Mion. &#147;Students ought to be citizens, and citizens
ought to be educated, especially in a democracy.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><font size="3">Within a Room<br>
</font><font size="1">Leslie Maxwell / Columnist</font></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Last Thursday, I was sitting in my Shakespeare class when
one of my friends made a random remark about &#147;that country we&#146;re bombing.&#148;
I turned around and innocently said, &#147;We&#146;re bombing someone?&#148; The
heat-seeking thermonuclear warheads could have been flying over the Atlantic toward us,
but I wouldn&#146;t have known about it.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, to answer all of your questions: No, I do not watch
the news. No, I don&#146;t read the paper, either. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">More and more this year, I have found myself isolated in a
happy little academic bubble. I can tell you all about 18th-century British Literature or
Elizabethan England, but when it comes to current events, I am horrendously uninformed. If
it doesn&#146;t make the Weather Channel&#146;s morning forecast or happen on ER, I
generally don&#146;t know about it. My world is often limited to what goes on between
Howard Hall and Courtyard II across the street. If Columbus suddenly came under nuclear
attack, everyone would be fleeing to the nearest bomb shelter, and I would still be
sitting in front of this computer writing next week&#146;s column.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I&#146;m always suffering from current event jet lag.
During President Clinton&#146;s impeachment trial, I would get an update every few days
when I talked to my parents on the phone. I figured that if I got too out of touch, one
day it would just dawn on me that Al Gore was being addressed as &#147;Mr. President&#148;
for a good reason. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Personally, I am much more concerned about my next research
paper than I am about the next development in Bill Clinton&#146;s private life. We live in
a Jerry-Springer society, but there are things I would rather not know about: stained
dresses and cigars included. I guess that is my excuse for not tuning in to the evening
news. I don&#146;t mind keeping up with world events, but I don&#146;t really care what
Dennis Rodman&#146;s latest antics are, much less what color his hair is at the moment. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I don&#146;t think that being an uninformed student is that
awful, however, and I don&#146;t think I am the only person who exists in a blissfully
ignorant academic sphere. College life is supposed to prepare us for the real world, but
it is also a time for us to enjoy ourselves, concentrate on our studies, and take
advantage of our last few years as students. I&#146;m enjoying these years, because when I
am out in the &#147;real&#148; world, I won&#146;t have the luxury to be clueless about
politics and world events. So, I&#146;m going to stay in my bubble (or within my room, I
should say) a little while longer, but if the Mother Ship lands in Muscogee County, will
someone please tell me? </font></p>

</font><font size="1">Athena Curry / Editor-in-Chief</font></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The committee on the status of women is making an effort to
be more visible on campus. In an attempt to raise the level of interest in the
organization the committee created a new website that is linked to the Columbus State
University site. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">According to Dianna Lomarcan, Systems Librarian and
committee secretary, although the committee has existed on campus for several years the
organization is becoming more pro -active on campus and in the community.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lomarcan says, &#147;Women&#146;s issues are not
necessarily on the forefront of people&#146;s minds. It&#146;s important for us to bring
these issues up.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">According to the organization&#146;s website, the
committee&#146;s purpose is to address concerns related to the employment, salaries, and
wages, and general welfare of women at Columbus State University. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Also according to the website, the committee deals with
problems and recommends policies and/or solutions that would change attitudes and
practices that restrict the growth and development of women on this campus. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The committee also takes on the responsibility to promote
awareness of women&#146;s issues on campus.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The committee&#146;s website includes information on
CSU&#146;s sexual assault policy, consensual relationships policy, and sexual harassment
policy. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The website also includes links to information, provided by
the university, regarding faculty salaries by rank and gender. The statistics show that
women on campus have lower salaries than their male colleagues.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lomarcan says the committee does not have any complaint
about women&#146;s salaries at the college now, but that part of the job of the committee
is to monitor trends in salaries and address any unfair practices the committee may find. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&#147;Hiring practices and pay are big concerns across the
country. We tried to include things on the website that people would be interested
in,&#148; Lomarcan says. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">At this time the committee is made up solely of women,
however, Lomarcan says there is nothing in the language of the committee&#146;s guidelines
that would prevent a male from joining the committee based on gender. Lomarcan says the
organization encourages involvement from men.</font></p>

</font><font size="1">Sgt Jim Boling / Public Safety Officer</font></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This week, we are issuing an appeal for YOUR help.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We need to locate some property which came up missing from
the Columbus Room in Davidson Center sometime on Friday, March 26.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Three carved wooden figures, representing three of the
major gods in the Buddhist faith, disappeared from a display during the celebration of
Diversity Week. These figures, each about eight-nine inches tall, are carved from a dark
red wood, similar to mahogany. (See photograph.)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The religious significance of these statues, and their
sentimental value to their owner, vastly outweigh their commercial value, which leads us
to make this appeal. Since we assume that they were Inadvertently packed up with something
else being moved (After all, who would deliberately steal another persons religious
icons?), we are asking that any person who has these items, or knows their whereabouts,
call, e-mail, or send a note to the Department of Public Safety, and let us know where
these treasures can be found. We will make sure they are returned to their owner, no
questions asked.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Look closely at the photograph included in this column, and
- please - keep an eye out for these three holy objects. They really do need to be back
with the others (there are more in the Buddhist pantheon), and not just decorating
someone&#146;s mantle or hall table. Consider how you would feel if you lost your own
religious relics, and how glad and relieved you would be to have them returned. Thanks for
your help.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Walters has a true love of music and plays the flute in
CSU&#146;s Symphonic Wind Ensemble, which presents concerts throughout the season in the
fine arts hall and toured high schools across the state earlier in the semester.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Besides the flute, Walters plays the piano and she plays
the sousaphone in the CSU pep band, which performs at many CSU home basketball games.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Walters is active on campus in other ways as a member of
many committees. She is a member of the publications committee, educator of the year
committee, scholastic honors committee and the status of women committee. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Walters says, &#147;I enjoyed serving on the educator of

</font><font size="1">Athena Curry / Editor-in-Chief</font></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Friday, April 2, the CSU youth orchestra performed two
concerts for area schools. The orchestra performs for area schools during fall and spring
semesters. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dianna Mann, concert manager, says the concert had a good
turnout. Mann says that because elementary schools in particular lack proper orchestra
instruction, it is important to introduce young people to this type of music. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The concert included a demonstration of each instrument in
the orchestra so students could get an idea of what each one looks and sounds like. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mann says, &quot;The purpose is to create an interest in
music for the students.&quot; She says that more and more young people are becoming
interested in orchestral music. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The orchestra is made up of students grades 2nd and up. The
youngest member is Samantha Shen from Matthews elementary, who plays the violin in the
orchestra. Samantha has been playing the violin for three years and Mann says that
experience, more than age or grade determines who can be in the orchestra. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Three years experience is usually the minimum
necessary to play,&quot; Mann says. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>No butts about it!!</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Smoking - it&#146;s nasty, right?! It makes you
unattractive and smelly. &amp;127;Smoking can kill you in numerous ways. Non-smokers have
to endure second hand smoke and cigarette butts littering their world everyday.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">GET OVER YOURSELVES!!!!</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Human beings are flawed. There are worse things we could be
doing besides smoking. What makes non-smokers so superior anyway? Do they not have any
other vices to speak of? Are smokers morally inferior to non-smokers? I say NO!</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Tobacco has been a part of America&#146;s economy from the
very beginning. We all put the stereotype on the South of only growing cotton. Tobacco is
a large part of the South&#146;s economy today, as it was a hundred years ago. Oh, but
those were the days before we realized that tobacco was bad for us.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Well, realize this, one of the reasons there has been a
rise in tobacco related deaths is because of all of the man-made junk that has been put in
tobacco products. People used to rip it out of the ground, roll it up, strike two rocks
together and enjoy a smoke.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">People are so sensitive these days. Everywhere you turn
someone is being harassed or oppressed or their rights are being violated. We are becoming
a society of paranoid tattle tales whose sole purpose is to create so many rules that
eventually you won&#146;t be able to scratch your nose without permission. (Someone might
interpret a threatening meaning from a gesture such as scratching your nose.)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We should all walk with our eyes tilted down, and do not
even think of violating someone else&#146;s personal space. By the way, that grass you are
walking on has feelings too! I digress, back to the issue at hand.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you don&#146;t want to smoke - don&#146;t. If you
don&#146;t want to be around cigarette smoke - don&#146;t associate with smokers. Sit in
the non-smoking section, don&#146;t go to places where smoking is allowed throughout the
establishment (bars, etc.), and most importantly - if you don&#146;t want your children to
smoke then teach them about the dangers involved.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Until we can all learn to get along, I have contrived a few
rules that non-smokers can follow so they can get along better with smokers. And, just to
prove that this issue is not one-sided, I have included some rules that smokers can follow
to be more courteous to non-smokers.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ways to make a smoker happy:<br>
1) Don&#146;t ride in a smoker&#146;s car and complain about the smoke.<br>
2) Don&#146;t say it is ok to sit in the smoking section and then complain.<br>
3) Don&#146;t get drunk and ask me for a cigarette.<br>
4) Never lie and say you are only a social smoker.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ways to make a non-smoker happy:<br>
1) Don&#146;t smoke right next to an entrance to a building.<br>
2) Don&#146;t smoke directly underneath a non-smoking sign.<br>
3) Don&#146;t blow smoke directly in a non-smoker&#146;s face while carrying on a
conversation.<br>
4) Don&#146;t ask to smoke in a non-smoker&#146;s car or house.<br>
5) Leave the decision on where to sit in a restaurant up to the non-smoker.</font></p>

</font><font size="1">A Letter from the Editor<br>
Athena Curry / Editor-in-Chief</font></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The days of chalkboards and dry erase boards have bit the
dust so to speak. At one time, multicolored chalk was an innovative way for professors to
get a message across to their students. There are professors at Columbus State University
who were teaching when people thought those &#147;computer things&#148; would never really
catch on and students who were born after the internet was created. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Of course, the reverse is true with professors like Robert
Oliver, 23, on the cutting edge of everything technical at the university and students (we
won&#146;t name names), whose grandchildren have forgotten more about computers than they
will ever know. Still, there are those professors young and old who are doing more than
keeping up with the times. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Of course, professors didn&#146;t get to be professors
because they&#146;re dummies. Even the die hard slide rule fans in the faculty office
building are making their way into the age of technology. There are those who just refuse
to learn anything more than absolutely necessary, like those who can read their e-mail,
but can&#146;t attach a file or still write e-mail messages in all caps. However, many
professors are ahead of the game.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Those professors who do go the extra mile should know that
we students appreciate the extra effort. Many professors include lecture notes on websites
that link to the CSU homepage for easy access. Almost all professors include an e-mail
address on their syllabus and many include a web address for more information. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Many, if not most, if not all professors accept disks in
replace of hard copies or prefer an e-mail to a phone call. Most students prefer it this
way, too. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Jettie Lights, Assistant Professor of Biology, has her own
website complete with up to date pictures, data and PowerPoint presentations to help her
students. The effort must be time consuming, but the information is not only helpful, it
is exactly what the professor ordered because she wrote it herself.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Ann Rosenthal has more than one site. Her sites include
not only help for her classes, but information for any web surfer out there who&#146;s
interested. Dr. Rosenthal shares web space with her children, who each have a link to
their websites on her site. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are so many professors using the resources available,
it&#146;s hard to imagine college without all the technology. So, for all those professors
out there who wrote their dissertations on typewriters and now know that java is more than
coffee, bravo and thanks a lot. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Editor,</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This letter is in response to a student&#146;s complaint
regarding the pricing structure at the Howard Deli.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The pricing structure at the deli was based on a campus
wide survey in which over 700 responses were received. The summary of those responses,
which included a statistical sample of students, staff and faculty, showed that customers
were willing to pay a little more for a superior sandwich.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The sandwiches made at the Deli are made on Fresh Baked
Bread and include Healthy Choice Deli meats. In comparison to other delis, such as Subway,
you will find that we put 33% more meat on each sandwich. In addition, we offer a choice
of &#147;Real Cheeses&#148; such as cheddar, mozzarella and provolone. Subway sandwiches
include processed cheeses in order to keep their food cost down.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In response to your plea, we will work on the development
of both breakfast and lunch value meals. In the meantime, you may want to consider
purchasing our Turkey, Chicken or Ham &#147;Deli Sandwiches&#148; and a Large Drink, which
will cost only $3.68. Our French Bread Pizza is another great buy at only $2.98 for a
Pizza and a Large Drink.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Columbus State University Dining Services are striving to
please our customers. We are in the process of developing a Customer Comment Board, where
comments can be posted along with responses from the Food Service Director. In addition,
we are in the process of developing both a &#147;Dine with the Director&#148; Program and
a &#147;Student Advisory Committee&#148;. The purpose of these programs is to open the
lines of communications between Dining Services and the students, faculty and staff and
propel our services to new heights. Please look for the advertisements regarding our
upcoming programs and participate, because YOUR OPINION COUNTS.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Editor,</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Since October, 1998, there has been a Self-defense Club on
campus. As the president of that club, I attempted to make a small splash in the water by
offering information on rape and assault prevention, self-protection skills, and so forth.
To my surprise, I received very little interest, with only about five CSU students and a
couple of outsiders in regular attendance. After talking with Dr. Ivy Mallisham in the
Counseling Center about being involved in rape awareness, and after discussing a possible
joining of forces with the officers at Public Safety, I was also surprised to find that no
one in these offices wanted to include the Self-defense Club in their activities.
Interestingly, one of the CSU deputies told me that he would stop by one of the
self-defense classes only if I offered free food!</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When the Sexual Assault Prevention Week hit campus, I
thought for sure that some new students would partake in the self-defense classes. After
all, campus police was offering their own self-defense class, so people would probably be
interested in learning more. I tried to get my foot in the door by talking to Rape Crisis
of Columbus, Inc., and Dr. Robin Lee, but to no avail. At the self-defense class offered
by public safety, we were told that it was not self-defense but &#147;survival
skills&#148; that would be taught. I still cannot figure out what&#146;s the difference.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As many of you probably saw, the Self-defense Club entered
the display contest for Sexual Assault Prevention Week. Many of you told me personally
that you couldn&#146;t understand why the Self-defense Club didn&#146;t place first,
second, or third. Many people on campus have told me that it&#146;s politics. The
Self-defense Club is a little fish in a big pond, and it hasn&#146;t made a big enough
splash to get noticed, so everyone&#146;s just looking the other way. What&#146;s funny is
that I was even interviewed by the Saber about three weeks ago about the club, and the
article has yet to be published. You know, I&#146;ve trained for some years in camouflage
techniques; I didn&#146;t realize how good I was.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Editor:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">President Bill Clinton has authorized the U.S. military to
engage in air strikes against a country with whom we are not at war, to end a centuries
old ethnic conflict which does not threaten the United States, in a part of Europe in
which we have no national self-interest. Why? Why are American soldiers being sent off to
die in this Balkan wasteland?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Bill Clinton has answered: &#147;It&#146;s a moral
imperative.&#148; The President&#146;s &#147;moral imperative&#148; is motivated entirely
by the desire to sacrifice American soldiers as global policemen. The essence of his
policy is, &#147;We have a duty to prevent any more atrocities from occurring precisely
because we don&#146;t have a national interest in Kosovo.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Yet, a foreign policy that abandons our self interest is
doomed to fail and can only result in tragedy. Already one U.S. plane has gone down and
despite hundreds of sorties by U.S. and British fighters, Slobodan Milosevic has increased
his assaults on ethnic Albanians. Milosevic knows he has nothing to fear from us. When our
legitimate interests have been at stake, such as with Iraq and Osama bin Laden, America
has demonstrated that it is only a paper tiger. Given America&#146;s past failures to
defend its interests and the inherent sacrifices of the current action, the bombing of
Serbia is doomed to fail.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">What is the solution? We must reject the sacrifice of
American lives and declare that the United States exists for its own sake. We must return
to the idea that our military exists to protect America - not Kosovar autonomy, oppressed
Albanians, Kurdish rebels, or starving Somalians. We must immediately withdraw from this
conflict, announce that our military will be used when only U.S. interests are at risk,
and uphold this policy consistently. This is the only way to regain our credibility,
protect America, and prevent such deadly mistakes in the future.</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">I think a fantastic idea would be to have lockers on this
    campus. Time and again I have heard students complain of the tons of books they have to
    carry around campus. And I myself have thought of how convenient it would be to have a
    stash for all the things I don&#146;t need on a daily basis. It would help for P. E.
    classes, things you need for organizations, clubs or whatever. My car looks like an
    office. I wouldn&#146;t think the cost would be too bad and it&#146;s not something that
    would have to be maintained. Students could provide their own locks if they use one. High
    schools, bowling alleys, bus stations and a number of places have lockers for use. Even if
    I had to pay a very small fee, and I reiterate very small, I wouldn&#146;t mind just for
    the convenience of having someplace to store my stuff. With normally six classes every
    semester, that adds up to a lot of weight of books not to mention the cost of them and the
    loss I would experience if I sat my bookbag down and they were stolen. Lockers! Think
    about it!</font></li>

  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">I&#146;m writing in regard to the CAAP test which I took on
    March 30 with every other graduating senior. I was under the impression that this test
    would gauge my reading comprehension, mathematical, scientific, and critical thinking
    skills; however, I now realize that this test&#146;s only purpose was to determine whether
    or not I am a total moron. After wasting over one hour of my time proofreading paragraphs
    containing grammatical errors, I was told that I could leave. &#147;What about the rest of
    the test,&#148; I asked. The proctor told me that I only had to take one section of the
    test. My question is: What do 72 questions requiring me to pluralize or punctuate tell
    university administrators about my writing skills? I would worry if a 6th grader
    couldn&#146;t pass this test. I certainly wouldn&#146;t administer this test to seniors in
    college, unless of course, I was worried about the quality of student I was allowing to
    slip through the doors with a diploma... Oh, I guess I do get it now. Columbus State
    University - if you had any type of admissions standards, you might not have to worry
    whether or not idiots were graduating.</font></li>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The last big concert news to hit Atlanta was that R.E.M.
planned to hold three shows this summer at Chastain Park. Of course, tickets are already
sold out. If you&#146;re like most Columbus natives, you probably didn&#146;t get your
greedy little hands on one. But don&#146;t worry, because in the making is something
possibly bigger.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hard Rock Productions, who is responsible for the Hard Rock

scheduled for June fifth, has already booked big names like Offspring, Third Eye Blind,
Sugar Ray, Everlast, and Collective Soul. Sharing the stage will also be the Mighty Mighty
Bosstones, Live, Eve 6, Better than Ezra, Silverchair, New Radicals, and Marvelous 3. And
guess where this all day event will take place: The Atlanta Motor Speedway.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The on-sale date for tickets has not been posted just yet.
But with the concert only two months away the tickets should go on sale very soon. The

</font><font size="1">Press Release from the State Theatre of Georgia, Springer Opera
House</font></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In 1876, Edwin Booth performed on the Springer Opera House
stage as the Shakespearean Dane Hamlet and amazed audiences with his strength, versatility
and rousing talent.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Eleven years after his infamous brother John Wilkes Booth
assassinated President Lincoln, Edwin&#146;s prestige as a theatre master remained
undisputed and the public adored him.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now the Ghost of the Springer leaps to life once again in a
rare theatrical event filled with humor, passion and drama. April 16, in a special
one-night event, the Springer Opera House and the Dorothy W. McClure Springer Theatre
Academy present John Ammerman&#146;s haunting &#147;Booth, Brother Booth.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Filled with compelling excerpts from some of
Shakespeare&#146;s greatest works, Booth, Brother Booth is a story of one of
America&#146;s greatest performers and the distinguished family of actors that made him a
legend.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Assisted with original music, sound effects arid
&#145;ghost&#146; voices, this one-man play wrestles with the speculation of Edwin
Booth&#146;s love and competition with his brother John Wilkes. Booth, Brother Booth is a
ghost play; not only of one man&#146;s tragic past and the voices that it conjures, but a
story of universal struggle and perseverance. Searching for a ray of hope against an
increasing mountain of despair, yet finding solace within the world of theatre.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Written and performed by John Ammerman, &#147;Booth,
Brother Booth&#148; premiered in 1995 at the Georgia Shakespeare Festival where Ammerman
is an associate artist. Ammerman went on to perform &#147;Booth&#148; at the newly
reconstructed Globe Theatre in London. In addition to holding an M.F.A. in acting/movement
from the University of Georgia, Ammerman was a former student in technique and pantomime
of the legendary Marcel Marceau. Ammerman&#146;s previous plays include &#147;Silent
Snapshots&#148;, &#147;The Five Faces&#148; and &#147;The School for Lovers.&#148;</font></p>

This past Monday night, Kappa Sigma hosted an All Greek Mixer at Rae&#146;s Pub. The Greek
bash was a huge success and all organizations present had great representation. Among the
participants were Sigma Nu, Phi Mu Kappa, Tau Kappa Epsilon, Delta Zeta, Kappa Sigma, Xi
Theta, and Sigma Omega.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">While Greek Week and Winterfest provide an opportunity for
Greeks to get involved, these events can often create strong competition between
organizations. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">At this event, there were no best participation plaques or
awards for enthusiasm. Monday night was strictly a chance for all fraternities and
sororities to just socialize and get to know each other better, without all the
competition. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Monday night also provided a great opportunity for rush.
Some students present were not Greek, but have been interested in rushing. Hopefully, the
unity displayed this past week will persuade these students to find out more about the
Greek way of life here at CSU.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Because of the huge turn out of both Greek and non-Greek
students, more of these mixers will be scheduled in the near future and, hopefully, the
Greek system here at CSU will grow even more than it has in recent years. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Kappa Sigma appreciates everyone&#146;s participation and
support and hopes that this is the only the beginning of a new brand of Greek unity here
on campus.</font></p>

</font><font size="1">Clayton Bryant / Sigma Nu</font></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sigma Nu National Fraternity has implemented an alcohol
awareness program entitled Alcohol 101. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The goal of Sigma Nu is to educate its members - past,
present, and future - on the consequences of alcohol abuse. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The program consists of a series of readings and tests that
every candidate, as well as each brother, must successfully complete. Alcohol 101 also has
an interactive CD-ROM that can be studied from any personal computer. The disk puts an
individual in a virtual party and requires them to make critical decisions regarding the
use of alcohol. For every decision made, good or bad, there is consequence. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In addition to Alcohol 101, Sigma Nu National Fraternity is
working towards all alcohol free housing to create a better learning environment for its
members.</font></p>

of Phi Mu Kappa Sorority<br>
</strong></font><font size="1">by Brandy N. Williams</font></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">1. I always have a sister who can be called upon for
guidance with anything. (school, work, parents, friends, relationships, etc ...)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">2. The sorority has instilled qualities in me that will
make me better qualified for jobs as a college graduate. (leadership, communication, and
organizational skills)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">3. The sorority&#146;s need for its members to achieve
academic excellence has made my G.P.A. a constant issue for me.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">4. I have learned the true meaning of &#147;Friends Forever
and Sisters for A Lifetime&#148;. Most women have experienced a &#147;back-stabbing~
friend at some time in their life. It is nice to know that I finally have a group of girls
that will never treat each other in a disrespectful way.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">5. Phi Mu Kappa is a true-to-heart group of girls who would
do anything for each other and that is why they are unique.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">6. My sorority is a fun-loving group. They know how to have
a good time, which is important. Socials are a blast if Phi Mu Kappas are any part of
them. Anything from the Crush Party, Founders Day Ball, The Rose Carnation Formal, Karaoke
Night, Pajama Party, no matter what it is, it will be fun if my sisters are there!</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">7. Rush is one of my favorite times of the semester; it is
when potential pledges get a chance to see why Phi Mu Kappa is different from everybody
else. I love to watch a girl fall in love with the sorority for what it is growing to be
and for what it stands for.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">8. I enjoy fundraisers as well (yes, I said fundraisers!).
If my sisters are involved, then it will be enjoyable. Fundraisers are also a great way
for me and my sisters to develop and use our enterprising skills.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">9. Philanthropy is one of my favorite things to do with my
sisters. It is a great bonding experience to get out there and work in the community.
Charity and hard work are a few more lessons that most college students are not taught in
the classroom. These lessons are priceIess and shouldn&#146;t be traded for all the credit
hours in the world!</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">10. Lastly the most important reason why I love being part
of Phi Mu Kappa sorority at Columbus State University, or maybe I should say the 31 most
important reasons are as follows: Cori, Heather, Ana, Lei, Tracie, Lynn, Terri, Jenny,
Kelly, Jaime, Stacey, Katie, Rachel, Karen, Eli, Josie, Molly, Dawn, Carla, Jacquelynne,
April, Jessica, Adrienne, Laura, Robin, Stephanie (Epsilon), Tabitha (Mascot), Kim
(Honorary in my eyes!), Jenny (Holy One), Kelly (Princess), and Stephanie (Roomie)!!!
T.M.T.Y. I LOVE YA&#146;LL!!!</font></p>
