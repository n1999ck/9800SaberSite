<p><font size="5"><strong>Students say meal plan #1 problem<br>
</strong></font><font size="2">Athena Curry / Editor-in-Chief</font></p>

<p>Dr. Earl Bagley, Vice President of Student Affairs, three
representatives from Atlanta architect firms and 14 students sat
down recently to discuss the good, the bad and the ugly of the
CSU campus.</p>

<p>H. Warren Snipes, Executive Vice President and Walter Miller,
Director of Planning and Design of Portman Architects and
Engineers and Lily del C. Berrios, AIA of Sizemore Floyd
Architects headed the Master Plan meeting on March 3rd to hear
what students like and dislike about the CSU campus.</p>

<p>Berrois said during the meeting, &#147;We wanted to hear
directly from the students. What are our strongest assets? What
do we need to improve?&#148;</p>

<p>Concerns for the students ranged from building problems to
incorrigible roommates.</p>

<p>Overwhelmingly, among the mostly dorm dwelling participants,
students&#146; main complaint is the meal plan. Students said the
meal plan is too expensive and too restrictive, not offering
meals at times when most college students are eating.</p>

<p>Students also said that there are few choices on campus and
that the food in the cafeteria is of poor quality and not very
healthy. </p>

<p>Lawrence Noles, pre-engineering major on campus, says, &#147;You
have to eat at school if you stay in Courtyard. There&#146;s no
choice.&#148;</p>

<p>Ryan Johnston, a CSU theater major, put it simply, &#147;It&#146;s
not good, but it&#146;s food.&#148;</p>

<p>Most of the students agreed that once meal plan users have
access to the new Healthy Choice Deli in Howard Hall, the problem
will be at least partially relieved.</p>

<p>Some students commented that on other campuses, such as
Mercer, meal cards can be used for vending machines and the book
store as well as the cafeteria.</p>

<p>Maria Holmes, Director of Auxiliary Enterprises, says that
meal cards like the ones at Mercer may be implemented in the
future at CSU, but it won&#146;t happen until at least Fall of
2000.</p>

<p>Other concerns for students were the lack of, and poor
condition of, guest parking lots for the dorms, loss of green
space due to construction and unsatisfactory lab equipment in
some buildings. </p>

<p>Along with discussion about needed improvements were comments
regarding CSU&#146;s positive aspects.</p>

<p>Most students in the forum cited campus size as their main
reason for choosing CSU. </p>

<p>&#147;I moved here to get into college life. I wanted to start
at a small college. I have a better relationship with my
professors here at a smaller campus,&#148; Noles said.</p>

<p>Students said that the small campus size makes it easy for
students to meet new people, build meaningful relationships with
their professors and become involved with many students
activities.</p>

<p>Students also like the individual dorm rooms and prospect of
the new P.E. complex.</p>

<p>The Spring Break Celebration will be held for its fifth year
during the week of April 12-18. The Columbus State University
Alumni Association puts on this event as a fundraiser for CSU
scholarships and faculty and staff development, such as attending
seminars. The proceeds are used for things that have a direct
impact on students, support scholarships and academic endeavors.</p>

<p>Controversy has arisen from the Spring Break Celebration. Dr.
Daniel Ross, Chair of the Department of Language and Literature,
said that the Celebration was &#147;undignified, not becoming of
what should be on a college campus.&#148; </p>

<p>He says, &#147;The whole thing is an eyesore, [the attendees]
tore up the grounds and the noise was a distraction to students
and faculty, particularly night classes.&#148; </p>

<p>Ross also raised the issue that parking becomes difficult as
one street is closed and says there are more positive ways of
raising money and having a cultural impact.</p>

<p>Dr. David Johnson, Professor in the Department of Language and
Literature, says he doesn&#146;t care one way or the other about
the Celebration except that he was disappointed to see a tree cut
down to accommodate the event. </p>

<p>Johnson is also concerned about the litter. &#147;Trash in the
parking lot [makes me] far more upset. It sets my day on edge to
see the trifleness of people and lack of social responsibility,&#148;
he says. </p>

<p>Dr. Harvey Richman, Professor of Psychology says, &#147;I didn&#146;t
see anything wrong with it, but maybe [the Celebration] was too
commercial, maybe overdone.&#148; </p>

<p>Also, says Richman, &#147;Fundraising is a good idea, but the
extensiveness of it is a bit much.&#148; Richmand suggest that
maybe the alumni should moderate the Celebration. </p>

<p>Dr. Jeanne Dugas, also Professor of Psychology, voiced her
opinion of the Celebration saying that she thinks it&#146;s just
fine. &#147;There&#146;s nothing wrong with sponsoring fun,&#148;
Dugas says. Dugas says those opposed to the Celebration are just
&#147;stuffy&#148;. </p>

<p>Dugas adds that she likes the change this year with the
addition of the &#147;Festival of Southern Culture&#148;. &#147;Anything
teaching is fine with me,&#148; says Dugas.</p>

<p>The &#147;Festival of Southern Culture&#148; is a new feature
this year that encompasses workways, dance, food, arts and
crafts, and music. Lakes says the festival is a way to celebrate
southern uniqueness. This part of the festivities will be on
Saturday and Sunday of the week, and a mini-version will be
presented on Friday with area schools being invited to visit as
field trips. </p>

<p>The Registrar&#146;s Office does not have any statistics on
the percentage of students attending CSU who have children, but
the diversity and changing faces of the students here would
incorporate a family event being sponsored on campus. Lakes says
that any ideas for this year&#146;s festival will be welcomed and
that more participation by students can contribute to the success
of the Celebration. </p>

<p>At this year&#146;s Celebration there will be approximately 30
rides, including a Ferris wheel, entertainment and food.
Admission for CSU students with identification is free and
regular admission for adults is $5.00, children 12-18 is $2.00,
and children under 12 is free with tickets available at Burger
King.</p>

<p>The first year the celebration was on a weekend and the alumni
association raised about $20,000 with attendance at over 7,500.
Those figures have increased with last year&#146;s profits
reaching $35,000 and attendance at 30,000. This year, Lakes says
that with good weather, attendance is expected to reach over
40,000.</p>

<p>Since the costs are fixed, with greater attendance, they will
yield more net proceeds. Lake says the event, &#147;has the
potential to be a major fundraiser for the alumni association
with proceeds expected to reach $80,000 at future [Spring Break
Celebrations].&#148;</p>

</strong></font><font size="2">Press Release from the National
Kidney Foundation of Georgia</font></p>

<p><strong>[picture caption] </strong>Tonya Watford (right),
volunteer activities director and a recent graduate of Kennesaw
State University, enjoys arts &amp; crafts with a young camper at
the National Kidney Foundation&#146;s Camp Independence. (picture

<p>The National Kidney Foundation of Georgia announces the
national campaign &#147;March is Kidney Month 1999.&#148; </p>

<p>The Foundation is dedicated to preventing kidney and urinary
tract diseases, improving the health and well-being of
individuals and families affected by these diseases and
increasing the availability of all organs for transplantation.</p>

<p>Kidney stones affect millions of Americans each year.
Increasing your fluid intake may help prevent kidney stones, and
now new studies show that what you drink is as important as how
much you drink.</p>

<p>According to one recent study, people who drank over 2.5
liters (about 2.5 quarts) of fluid daily had a 38 percent lower
risk of developing a stone than people drinking less than 1.4
liters (about 1.5 quarts) daily. The researchers also examined
the relationship between 17 different beverages and the risk for
symptomatic kidney stones. Surprisingly, the risk was lowered
among coffee (regular or decaffeinated), tea and wine drinkers,
while grapefruit juice seemed to increase the risk. In fact, each
additional 3 ounces of grapefruit juice a day increased the risk
by 44 percent. Beverages like coffee, tea and wine may reduce
stone risk by increasing the flow of a more dilute urine, but the
reasons for the higher risk with grapefruit juice are not clear. </p>

<p>Other beverages like milk, soda and other juices did not seem
to affect the risk of stones in this study.</p>

<p>In another recent study, cola drinks were implicated as a
possible culprit of kidney stone formation in men. When a group
of heavy cola drinkers (at least 5 1/3 ounces a day) who had
suffered a previous bout of kidney stones cut their consumption
of colas to less than half their customary levels, they were
almost one third less likely to experience a recurrence of
stones.</p>

<p>The main symptoms of kidney stones are severe pain, nausea and
vomiting, frequent need to urinate, burning urination, blood in
the urine and blocked flow of urine. If infection is present, you
may have fever and chills and cloudy or foul-smelling urine. If
you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor.</p>

<p>For more information about the kidney stones, your kidneys and
kidney disease, contact the National Kidney Foundation of Georgia
at (404) 248-1315 or toll-free in Georgia at 1-800-633-2339. </p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Rape Prevention leader visits<br>
</strong></font><font size="2">Press Release from the Office of
Public Relations, CSU</font></p>

<p><strong>[picture caption]</strong> Katie Koestner, who will be
visiting CSU to speak on rape awareness, was featured in TIME
Magazine in 1991. (picture of TIME magazine June 3, 1991)</p>

<p>Columbus State University and Columbus Rape Crisis will
present Sexual Assault Education and Prevention Week, March
22-26. Events will include a poster contest for CSU student
organizations, training by law enforcement personnel, workshops
and an evening &#147;candlelight&#148; rally and presentation for
the Columbus community.</p>

<p>Katie Koestner will conduct workshops and deliver the week&#146;s
keynote address. Koestner, featured by HBO and TIME magazine
regarding her ordeal as a victim of date rape while in college,
and instrumental on Capitol Hill in getting sexual assault
legislation passed, will present a series of programs on
Wednesday, March 24, at Columbus State University. The programs,
free and open to the public, are sponsored by CSU and Columbus
Rape Crisis in conjunction with Sexual Assault Education and
Prevention Week, March 22-26.</p>

<p>At 3 p.m. in the Davidson Center auditorium, Koestner and
Brett Sokolow, a lawyer and expert on date rape, will present
&#147;He Said&#151;She Said,&#148; an interactive program that
shares the message of prevention through respect and
responsibility, and combines typical stereotypical
misunderstandings between the sexes with scenarios of typical
student sexual interactions. The audience is invited to ask
questions and act as a jury, voting on whether the scenario
describes a consensual or non-consensual sexual experience.
Following the formal program, Koestner and Sokolow will
facilitate discussions about the scenarios in either single sex
break-out groups or with the co-ed audience.</p>

<p>Koestner&#146;s keynote speech, &#147;No&#151;Yes,&#148; will
begin at 7 p.m. in the Davidson auditorium. She will discuss her
journey from victim to survivor, weaving her story with vignettes
from survivors across the country and offering a message of
successful sexual communication, responsibility, and respect.</p>

<p>Koestner&#146;s personal experience with campus sexual assault
led to her becoming a national spokesperson for awareness of this
silent yet prevalent problem. Her courage in speaking out helped
give a name and a face to date rape, a crime that few ever spoke
about. She earned degrees in public policy and women&#146;s
studies in 1994, Pi Beta Kappa and Magna cum Laude, from the
College of William and Mary. Koestner has presented her acclaimed
program to hundreds of thousands of students at more than 600
colleges, high schools, and military institutions
internationally.</p>

<p>A certified peer educator and sexual assault counselor,
Koestner founded Students Helping Others to Understand Trauma
(SHOUT) at Cornell University and the Sexual Assault Companions
Program at William and Mary.</p>

<p>The other day I was reading a list of witty sayings entitled,
&#147;There should be a button that says. . .&#148;. One of the
quips reminded me of our culture; it said: &#147;I thought I
wanted a career; turns out I just wanted paychecks.&#148; I was
struck by how many people it described, especially people in my
generation. </p>

<p>I think that over the last generation, we have lost our work
ethic in America. The baby boomers grew up penny-pinched because
their parents had suffered through the Great Depression. So, when
the baby boomers had kids, they decided to give them &#147;everything
that they never had.&#148; Sure, that was a great sentiment, but
sometimes I think that we Generation X-ers had it a little too
easy. </p>

<p>Many of us in my generation, including me, grew up with not
only everything we needed, but most of what we wanted as well. We
coasted through childhood saying, &#147;Give me this&#148; and
&#147;I want that&#148; without having a strong concept of
reality. No matter how many times dad said &#147;Money doesn&#146;t
grow on trees,&#148; we seldom stopped to contemplate where it
did come from. </p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, we toss that mortar board and are
expected to start taking responsibility for our own lives. We
walk out into the world, thinking, &#147;I&#146;m here! Now where&#146;s
my high pay - low exertion job, sport utility vehicle, and
comfortable home?&#148; We expect the world to hand us success on
a silver platter, and when it doesn&#146;t happen, we can&#146;t
understand why. </p>

<p>We go to college and the professors expect huge amounts of
work, and the mediocre slap-dash work of high school just doesn&#146;t
cut it anymore. Bills start rolling in: tuition, rent, car
payments, textbooks, grocery bills. Not to mention the things you&#146;ve
been used to all your life: eating out, movies, expensive
clothes, etc. We slowly start to down-grade our tastes to ramen
noodles, and we start to feel less embarrassed folding our
underwear at the laundromat. </p>

<p>The point is, too many people feel that the world owes them a
living. It doesn&#146;t. With few exceptions, you won&#146;t get
anything out of anything if you don&#146;t work for it. In
education, especially, the more effort you put into it, the more
results you get back. I had to figure this out for myself when I
moved from pampered high school days to college and the real
world. I live in Courtyard II, and I only make $50-70 a week
between tutoring and writing this column. You better believe that
I don&#146;t have any problem eating ramen noodles or folding my
underwear in public. </p>

<p>I think we all need to be a little more conscious that there
isn&#146;t a ready-made niche on the upper end of the latter just
out there waiting for us. The only niche that we&#146;ll get in
life is one that we carve out of the rock with our own sweat and
ambition. </p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Public Safety Means YOUR Safety<br>
</strong></font><font size="2">Sergeant Jim Boling / Public
Safety Officer</font></p>

<p>Are you prejudiced? C&#146;mon now, really, is there anything
about certain classes or groups of people that just makes you
automatically dislike or distrust them? Sure there is. We ALL
have certain prejudices which we&#146;ve probably carried around
with us since we were very young and now don&#146;t even think
about.</p>

<p>My own is an intense dislike for upper-middle class Yuppies
from Monterey, California who have both ski racks and bicycle
racks on their mini-vans. But, I don&#146;t go out looking for
these people to shoot them, blow up their homes, or terrorize
them in general. In other words, I&#146;ve learned to control my
prejudice and not let it manifest itself as discrimination.
Besides, this particular species is very rare in this part of the
country (maybe one reason I chose to live here).</p>

<p>But what if the object of your personal prejudice is all
around you? Can you &#147;un-learn&#148; these deep-rooted
feelings and fears? Maybe, and maybe not; all that&#146;s certain
is that you can refrain from any overt discriminatory practice
against other people, no matter where you are. If you do this for
long enough, pretty soon you&#146;ll find that the prejudice
diminishes and is no longer getting in the way of your
experiencing all the best life has to offer.</p>

<p>What does this have to do with Public Safety? It&#146;s very
simple - if everyone harnesses their unreasonable prejudices and
learns a little tolerance for folks who are unlike themselves, we
won&#146;t hear any more about Hate Groups, Hate Crimes, and
Hate-Mongers. It doesn&#146;t mean we&#146;ll all fall into each
others&#146; arms in a giant lovefest of New Age Harmony, it
would only mean we&#146;d quit killing each other over
differences which are beyond our control.</p>

<p>Now whatever your personal prejudice may be - racial, ethnic,
religious, nationalistic, linguistic, sexual, or minivan-istic,
try putting it aside for one day. After that, try for a week, and
then a month. If you can ditch this negative for a month, you&#146;re
probably well on the way to overcoming your prejudice on a
permanent basis. When enough people do this, your friendly local
Five-Oh in Public Safety can forget fighting hate crimes, and go
try to find your stolen bookbag.</p>

<p><strong>Remember, Public Safety Means Your Safety!!</strong></p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>The Legend of St. Patrick's Day<br>
</strong></font><font size="2">Bridgette Brumbaugh / Staff Writer</font></p>

<p>In his youth Patrick was a pagan, but things changed when he
was 16. Warriors raided the cost of Whales and kidnapped him. In
Ireland, they sold him into slavery, but after six years of
imprisonment, he escaped. </p>

<p>Legend has it that Patrick had a religious vision showing him
converting the Irish to Christianity. He soon went to a monastery
in Gaul, Italy to study for 12 years. He was ordained a deacon
and later consecrated a Bishop, taking on the Christian name
Patricius. </p>

<p>When a Bishop had been killed after only a year as head of the
first Irish mission, Patrick was sent to replace him. He knew the
Irish customs and the language, because of his time in captivity,
and used this to his advantage. He spoke to the Irish on their
terms, connected their traditions to Christianity, and was soon
accepted as one of their people. He was able to convert important
nobility and create a local clergy.</p>

<p>He built his first church in Saul and from there went all over
Ireland. He was said to use the shamrock to explain the holy
trinity to the people. His contemporaries said he was
charismatic, courageous, and possessed an extraordinary zeal.
Patrick continued his mission of conversion for 29 years. He died
on March 17, 461 AD. Legend says he was buried at Downpatrick
with Saints Bridget and Columcille. In the 17th century he became
recognized as a saint. </p>

<p>St. Patrick&#146;s Day is a National Holiday in Ireland. On
March 17th all businesses, except restaurants and pubs, close for
the day. People attend mass and traditionally pray for
missionaries.</p>

<p>America held its first celebration in Boston in 1797. Today,
we celebrate with green beer, parades and traditional Irish food.
Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York, and Savannah hold
some of the largest festivals in the nation to honor St. Patrick.
</p>

<p>St. Patrick&#146;s Day is also celebrated in Canada, areas of
Australia, Singapore, and a few other countries.</p>

<p><strong>[picture caption]</strong> Dr. Jaynie Nesmith has been
nominated for this year&#146;s Outstanding Faculty Woman award.
(photo by Grant Salter)</p>

<p>This is our second article in our Women&#146;s History Month
series.</p>

<p>The nominee for Outstanding Faculty Woman is Dr. Jaynie
Nesmith. She has been the assistant to the Vice President of
Academic Affairs for several years. On July 1, 1998, when the
University College was created, Dr. Nesmith was named as the
Dean. This made her one of the two highest female administrators
on campus. </p>

<p>In 1994, Dr. Nesmith received the Faculty Service Award at
CSU, and will soon receive a Woman of Excellence Award from the
Girl Scout Council when it is announced at the end of March. Dr.
Nesmith was awarded the opportunity to attend leadership training
as well. While she was in Meriwhether County, she was invited to
Leadership Meriwhether and has also attended a leadership program
at Harvard University. She believes this training helped her
become the Dean of University College.</p>

<p>Nesmith is very active in the community. With a background in
Education, Dr. Nesmith has been on several boards, including The
Muscogee Excellence Education Foundation, which selects the
Teacher of the Year. She has been involved with the Cancer
Society and the Heart Foundation as well. She feels her most
important community activity is reading to children. </p>

<p>Dr. Nesmith says she feels very fortunate to work with a great
faculty and staff at CSU. The support of Dr. Frank Brown,
President of CSU, and Thomas Jones, Vice President of Academic
Affairs has helped her greatly. She believes she is fortunate to
be at CSU and that, with the help of a great administration, she
has had opportunities other females may not have had. She says
that as long as you love what you do, you could achieve your
dreams.</p>

<p>Dr. Nesmith received her undergraduate degree and her
doctorate from Auburn University. She has also attended Georgia
State and Columbus College.</p>

<p>Spring Break 1999 is officially over! So much for fun in the
sun. Those of you who chose to go to Panama City this year
probably spent more time in your hotel rooms than on the beach.
Jack Frost just won&#146;t go away. You don&#146;t really need
the sun to have fun though!</p>

<p>Most activities can be done indoors. Let&#146;s face it, most
women go the beach to get whistled at and to get free drinks.
Men...well...it doesn&#146;t take a great imagination to figure
out what they are there for. Binge-drinking and sex (preferably
with a stranger).</p>

<p>The man who can funnel more then two beers at a time is king
during this week of indulgence. It reminds me of the Roman
tradition of celebrating the Winter Solstice. One week of pure
over-indulgence and decadence. This is not to say we party like
the Romans (we would all be dead).</p>

<p>While it is fun to cut loose and be wild, I hope everyone
parties safely. Oh, and the tanning! Hats off to those of you who
use tanning beds. When we are all 60 years old I will still have
beautiful tight peaches and cream skin, while the rest of you
give a new meaning to the word leatherface. By the way, is there
such a thing as self-tanning lotion that doesn&#146;t turn people
orange?</p>

<p>I myself celebrated in true Spring Break fashion in Cozumel,
Mexico. </p>

<p>With a number 48 sunblock to protect my delicate skin, we
partied like it is 1999. This was definitely an unforgettable
Spring Break.</p>

<p>That is what it is really all about. Building memories with
friends you will have forever (and building blackmail material
you can use forever). It is a time to party! So, cut loose and
have fun, and remember that condoms are our friends!</p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>A not-so-Spring Break<br>

</font><font size="2">Athena Curry / Editor-in-Chief</font></p>

<p>Last week was spring break, time to dust off the old snow
skis, snuggle up by the fire and head for the mountains! Wait . .
. that doesn&#146;t sound like Spring Break. Well, it does now.</p>

<p>Remember when spring break was in spring? There was a time
when spring break meant loading up and heading out to Panama City
to enjoy the sun and surf. Head for Panama City this Spring Break
and you&#146;ll spend it in the hotel room with the heat on.</p>

<p>Two weeks into March is just too chilly to enjoy the
traditional spring break activities. The days aren&#146;t too
bad, but there will be no nighttime clambakes on the beach this
time of the year. </p>

<p>The Muscogee County public schools aren&#146;t out for another
week. The end of March is better than the beginning, but the
beginning of April would be even better. May is too close to
June, when kids get out for the summer and March, as we&#146;ve
established is too cold for a proper spring break. As for CSU
students, it&#146;s Mai Tais by the fireplace instead of in a
lounge chair by the pool. </p>

<p>No one expects a summertime scorcher, but short sleeved
weather is preferable for a spring vacation. Springtime is
supposed to be a time to frolic nude in the flowers, drink
strawberry wine and turn our faces to the sun. Well, at the
beginning of March you can drink wine, the rest of the activities
will be postponed until, well, spring.</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>

<p>I recently initiated the organization of a new school club
called the &#147;Freethought Society.&#148; This organization&#146;s
goal is to be an alternative club to discuss philosophy and other
issues as well as have social interactions. Last week, I placed
many posters around campus, with permission and when I returned
to campus over spring break, the majority of my posters had been
taken down. Snatched down would be a more appropriate way of
saying it as there were still little corners of the colored paper
stuck or tacked in many places. No other posters or flyers where
mine were had been removed. </p>

<p>This university states that it is dedicated to &#147;educating
students to think critically, work creatively, communicate
effectively&#148; and to meet &#147;the academic, social,
cultural, and health needs of students through co-curricular
activities, student services, and a strong academic advisement
program.&#148; And further, to foster &#147;the cultural, ethnic,
racial, and gender diversity of students, faculty, and staff.&#148;</p>

<p>These are some of the very same aspirations of the Freethought
Society. I&#146;d like to say to whomever out there that they
should study the mission statement of this university and take
note the next time they run around removing my posters. I can
only guess that the possible controversy surrounding this group
has put fear into someone who is threatened by our grouping of
atheists, agnostics, skeptics and humanists. Instead of
childishly trying to stifle my advertising and thus, infringing
on my basic constitutional right of freedom of speech, why don&#146;t
you try and attend a meeting (March 16 at 12:30 in Arnold 106)?</p>

<p>For any information feel free to contact me at:
grant_lisa@colstate.edu or 660-5514 and leave a number.</p>

<p>Sincerely Yours,<br>
Lisa Grant</p>

<p>Can someone please get on the ball and correct these clocks on
campus? The clock tower is out yet again, and there&#146;s one in
Howard Hall that has never been right in the year and a half I&#146;ve
been here. Most of the classroom clocks that I observe are wrong.
In Stanley Hall last semester, the clock hands kept spinning
throughout class! We were just waiting for the walls to fall down
and we&#146;d be in a space warp.</p>

<p>If it takes hiring a full time clock monitor it&#146;d be
worth it. Some professors are not very understanding if you are
late for class (I&#146;ll refrain from centing. . .er, I mean
saying any names). And we have enough stress in our lives without
having to fume over the time. Yes, I could buy a watch but if
that is what I need to do, why have any clocks at all on campus?
They are here, so let&#146;s get them working accurately. Time&#146;s
a wasting. </p>

<p>----------------------------------------- </p>

<p><strong>In response to last week&#146;s reader poll:</strong></p>

<p>Homosexuality is not a disease! No it CANNOT be cured! That is
the attitude many people take who are afraid and ignorant. I
truly believe that God created me this way. I can choose to give
in to what society deems as &#147;normal&#148; by being with
someone of the opposite sex, but it would not be who I am inside,
just as a heterosexual can have sexual relations with someone of
the same sex and still consider themselves straight. We should
stop trying to change people to be more like ourselves and accept
diversity as a beautiful gift from God.</p>

<p>-----------------------------------------</p>

<p>Your poll asked: &#147;Is homosexuality something that should
be cured?&#148; </p>

<p>My answer is NO. </p>

<p>I believe that society needs to become more tolerant. As I
think back throughout history. There have been many instances
when people who were different were ostracized. Even as late as
this century when I was in school in the 1950&#146;s people who
were left-handed were forced to change. I can remember my friend
would naturally pick up her pencil and start to write with her
left hand. Almost immediately the teacher would make her change
to her right hand, which was very awkward for her. Now we know
that some people are naturally born to be left handed. </p>

<p>In the same way some people are born to respond emotionally
and sexually to member of the same sex. There is nothing sick or
unnatural or sinful about it. </p>

<p>The owner of the limousine that was used during the Raven vs.
Hak match on the March 8 Nitro, which saw Bam Bam Bigelow get
involved, was very upset that it was used for the match and
damaged. Oops. It did make for a good prop during the match,
though. </p>

<p>Word is that Sick Boy will be returning very soon with a new
gimmick. WCW negotiated with no holds barred fighter, Mark
Coleman, about doing a worked match with Goldberg at Uncensored,
but decided against the plan. WWF is expected to bring in some no
holds barred fighters, such as Tank Abbott and Mark Kerr, as
potential Brawl For All opponents for Bart Gunn. </p>

<p>Scotty Riggs, Mike Enos, and Brian Adams may form a stable in
the near future. By the time this gets read by anybody, WCW
&#147;Uncensored&#148; will be over and done with. It is rumored
on the internet that both Ric Flair and Hollywood Hogan want to
revert back to their characters of old, with Hogan doing a
revised &#147;Red and Yellow&#148; good guy character and Flair
doing the &#147;not so nice cheater&#148; character. If this
happens , it will start to unfold in the next few weeks if it
didn&#146;t start at &#147;Uncensored.&#148; Either way, expect
Flair and Hogan to exchange the WCW Title back and forth a few
times, again maybe starting with Flair winning the belt at &#147;Uncensored.&#148;
</p>

<p>With &#147;Wrestlemania&#148; just weeks away, there will be
more WWF stuff to talk about in the next few weeks, but it is
kind of slow right now. Adios.</p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Music Bits: 80's bands to tour together<br>
</strong></font><font size="2">Brian Hale / Entertainment Editor</font></p>

<p><strong>[picture caption] </strong>Tommy Petty performs for a
very receptive audience. (<a href="http://www.tompetty.com">http://www.tompetty.com</a>)</p>

<p><strong>&gt;&gt; </strong>Long live the 80&#146;s. Check this
out - Poison, L.A. Guns, Ratt and Great White will hit the road
together on a tour scheduled to kick off on Memorial Day weekend.
Poison&#146;s agent told MTV News that the dates are not
confirmed, but the bands are. The tour headlines the original
Poison, including returning guitarist C.C. DeVille, along with
singer Bret Michaels, bassist Bobby Dall and drummer Rikki
Rockett. A spokesperson for Poison tells MTV News that Michaels
and crew have been in the studio recording on and off over the
last year or two, but says there will not be a new Poison album
released prior to the tour. The spokesperson confirms the group
is currently working without a label, but notes that they are
leaving their options open.</p>

<p><strong>&gt;&gt; </strong>Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers
ended their two-year absence from the stage last week at San
Francisco&#146;s Fillmore, and took some time to preview a few
new songs for the lucky fans. &#147;Room at the Top,&#148; &#147;Swingin&#146;,&#148;
and &#147;Free Girl Now&#148; were the new songs, and are taken
from the upcoming album,&#148;Echos.&#148;</p>

<p>Tom and the band,guitarist Mike Campbell, bassist Howie
Epstein, keyboardist Benmont Tench, guitarist Scott Thurston, and
drummer Steve Ferrone also reached deep into their songlist for
the show. The band played several classics, including &#147;Listen
To Her Heart,&#148; &#147;I Won&#146;t Back Down,&#148; and
&#147;Mary Jane&#146;s Last Dance.&#148; &#147;American Girls&#148;
and &#147;Even The Losers&#148; were played during the acoustic
set of the show. &#147;Echoes&#148; will hit stores in April.</p>

<p><strong>&gt;&gt; </strong>Ol&#146; Dirty Bastard was in a Los
Angeles court room, AGAIN, last week to plead not guilty to
charges that he was recently found wearing a bulletproof vest.
That is an illegal act for convicted felons. ODB, unfortunately,
fits the bill of a convicted felon, so off to jail and court for
him, again. </p>

<p>ODB also told the court that he is facing financial hardship
and that he could no longer afford an attorney. After he pleaded
not guilty to the charge, ODB watched his bail increased from
$15,000 to $115,000. He should have just admitted it. As of late
last week, ODB was still in police custody, so relax, we can all
sleep a little easier for the time being. If found guilty of the
charge, he could face between 16 months and three years in jail.
Three years with no ODB? Whatever will I write about?</p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Brain Bank needs donors<br>
</strong></font><font size="2">Lisa Grant / Staff Writer</font></p>

<p>With your help, researchers can develop more refined treatment
and better prognoses for those now suffering with neurologic and
psychiatric illnesses. Hope can be provided for the millions of
people who wonder, each day, when or if symptoms will soon
appear. Research also assures a healthier future for all of the
unborn children who are at risk for inheriting a neurologic or
psychiatric illness tomorrow.</p>

<p>Research over the past decade has shown that the study of
human brain tissue is essential to increase our understanding of
how the nervous system functions. Most recently, postmortem human
brain research played a significant role in the development of a
genetic test for Huntington&#146;s disease and treatment for
Parkinson&#146;s disease. Current reports indicate that a gene
associated with one form of dystonia will soon be isolated, but
only if individuals donate more brain tissue afflicted with this
disease. </p>

<p>Similarly, several neurochemical and anatomical studies
focusing on neurologic and psychiatric disorders are under way.
Unfortunately, many are being delayed due to the scarcity of
tissue donors.</p>

<p>The McLean Brain Tissue Resource Center (commonly known as the
Brain Bank) was established in 1978 as a centralized resource for
the collection and distribution of human brain specimens for
research and diagnostic studies. Over the years, hundreds of
scientists from the nations top research and medical centers have
requested tissue from the Brain Bank for their investigations.
Since the majority of these studies can be carried out on a very
small amount of tissue, each donated brain provides a large
number of samples for many researchers.</p>

<p>For comparative purposes brain tissue is needed from healthy
individuals, as well as from those who died with neurologic or
psychiatric illness. There is also a critical need for relatives
of people with genetically inherited disorders to donate their
brains after death. When possible, a small portion of frozen
tissue taken form each brain donated to the Brain Bank will be
kept available to serve as a resource for future (DNA) testing.</p>

<p>Becoming a prospective tissue donor is easy. Any person, 18
years of age or older, can simply complete the forms and send
them by the Brain Bank (1-888-BRAIN-BANK). Then, do the most
important thing of all, inform your family that you would like
your brain donated to the McLean Brain Tissue Resource Center
after death. Your next of kin must be available to verify your
intent to donate at the time of death.</p>

<p>Even if a decision to donate was not made prior to death,
family members can arrange for the donation of brain tissue after
an individual&#146;s death. In all cases, the identity of each
donor and potential donor will remain confidential. After an
autopsy is performed, only a donor&#146;s brain will be sent to
the Bran Bank. The donor&#146;s body will not need to be
transported. </p>

<p>Brain donation does not interfere with an open casket or other
traditional funeral arrangements. When appropriate, a diagnostic
report will be sent to the family and health professionals
involved with the case.</p>

<p>There are three major reasons why a brain generally becomes
unsuitable for donation: 1) when a person dies while on a
respirator 2) When a person dies from a highly contagious disease
and 3) when a person plans to make a whole body donation to a
medical school. </p>

<p>Government grants and private foundations fund the McLean
Brain Bank. Usually, brain donation involves no cost to the
family. Occasionally, however, charges may be incurred with the
local hospital or funeral director. For more information call
1-800-BRAIN-BANK.</p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>New sorority going strong<br>
</strong></font><font size="2">The Sisters of Sigma Omega</font></p>

<p>Only five months old, Columbus State University&#146;s
youngest sorority is off to an enormous start. Five women founded
Sigma Omega on Sept. 9, 1998, and have more than doubled its size
since then. Sigma Omega has made many outstanding accomplishments
and plans for the future.</p>

<p>Spring Rush was a success, involving an ice cream social, cook
out at the clock tower, karaoke, game night, and dinner at
Applebee&#146;s. Jill Gildart, Kim Hancock, Kymber Huff, Ashley
Johnson, and Heidi Kienz received bids on Feb. I I and are
currently going through an educational program.</p>

<p>On March 1, Sigma Omega supported the Sigma Nu snake auction
held in the Davidson Cafeteria. The sisters bought a total of
four brothers, donating more than one hundred twenty dollars.</p>

<p>Spring semester is a busy time for the new sorority. The
sisters of Sigma Omega are hosting a &#145;Luck of the Irish
Social&#146; on March 19. There is also an open invitation to all
sororities to participate in an auction to raise money for a
variety of philanthropies and organizations.</p>

<p>Sigma Omega&#146;s Teacher of the Month will begin in April.
Teachers will receive gifts from local sponsors and will be
featured in the Saber. A blood drive with the Kappa Sigma
Fraternity, face painting at the Spring Carnival, and the March
of Dimes Walk are all coming up next month. Much more is still to
come. If you have any interesting or exciting ideas, please
contact any Sigma Omega sister.</p>

<p>The opportunities are endless with the best, new sorority on
campus. If any women are interested in the Sisterhood of Sigma
Omega and would like to receive more information, please contact
Jackie Velez (569-2774) or Jenn Horn (569-2743).</p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Sigma Nu host Snake Auction<br>
</strong></font><font size="2">Clayton Bryant / Sigma Nu</font></p>

<p>Ever since the Mu Xi chapter of Sigma Nu was founded, it has
been recognized as one of the largest philanthropy based
organizations around. </p>

<p>All year long Sigma Nu has given sizable donations to a
4-year-old girl stricken with aplasmic-anemia. In addition, on
March 1, 1999, Sigma Nu took the Davidson cafeteria by storm with
the 3rd annual Snake Auction to raise money for the Valley Rescue
Mission. </p>

<p>The brothers of Sigma Nu, with the support from a few area
restaurants and movie theaters, hit the auction block to be sold
to the highest bidder. </p>

<p>Kris Lambert, who is in charge of fundraising for Sigma Nu,
organized the auction.</p>

<p>In April, brothers will play host to the Valley Rescue Mission
with the third annual Sigma Nu Easter egg and treasure hunt.</p>
