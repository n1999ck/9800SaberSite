<p>On Sunday, June 20, CSU students might have thought they were
crazy if they saw the over 2,000 bicyclists setting up camp on
CSU&#146;s grounds. In actuality, these people were competing in
the Bike Ride Across Georgia, or BRAG, and had just finished the
first leg of their trip.</p>

<p>This year&#146;s ride was 434 miles long, stretching from
LaGrange to Savannah, making stops along the way in many
different cities across the state.</p>

<p>To many, this trek sounds painful; why would anyone willingly
agree to ride a bike from one side of Georgia to another? Those
who join BRAG every year will tell skeptics that the ride is
truly enjoyable.</p>

<p>BRAG is a six-day ride filled with fun. When the riders
stopped in Columbus for the first night, shuttles carried them to
Hollywood Connection and to a Redstixx game. The Platters
performed at an ice cream social in Thomaston on Monday night,
and a bike stunt show was held in Perry the next night. On
Wednesday, the BRAG talent show took place in Dublin and featured
the BRAG kazoo marching band. Thursday, in Metter, the &#147;BRAGster
dragster&#148; racers were held. Friday night&#146;s stop in
Statesboro included a performance by the band Downright Brothers.
At the final stop, in Savannah, a barbecue lunch complete with a
birthday cake was served to celebrate BRAG&#146;s 20th
anniversary.</p>

<p>BRAG began in 1980 under the name of the Great GASBE (Georgia&#146;s
Annual State Bicycling Event) with only 120 riders, 60 of which
completed the journey. The event was started by Savannah resident
Dot Moss, but had no sponsorship.</p>

<p>By 1989, the name had been changed to BRAG, the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution became the first major corporate sponsor,
and Jerry Colley became the race director.</p>

<p>Inconveniently enough, it was not until 1992 that portable
bathrooms and showers at rest stops were added.</p>

<p>Now, the event is a huge success, with participant&#146;s ages
ranging from toddlers to 70-somethings. The cost is low compared
to many cross-state rides throughout the country-only $115 for
adults.</p>

Cummins.</p>

<p>Dr. Richard Skinner To Head New Unit, Expand On-line Programs
for Non-Traditional Students and Employers </p>

<p>ATLANTA&#151;(May 12) &#151; Technology savvy working
professionals and non-traditional students seeking on-line
learning to prepare for today&#146;s hot jobs soon will have
&#147;anytime, anywhere&#148; access to programs offered by the
University System of Georgia, with the launch of a new enterprise
called Georgia GLOBE. </p>

<p>Georgia GLOBE (Global Learning On-line for Business and
Education) is a new entrepreneurial unit launched today by the
Board of Regents to help meet the state&#146;s higher education
and workforce demands via electronic delivery systems. </p>

<p>Dr. Richard Skinner, president of Clayton College &amp; State
University, has been named by University System of Georgia
Chancellor Stephen R. Portch to serve as president and chief
executive officer of Georgia GLOBE, effective June 1, 1999.
Skinner will report directly to Portch, and his unit will be
housed in Atlanta. </p>

<p>&#147;The University System has been building to this &#145;eureka
moment&#146; for quite some time,&#148; stated Portch. &#147;We
have been in the entrepreneurial phase for the past five years,
building our technology infrastructure along with faculty
excitement and support for the use of technology on and off of
our campuses. Now it&#146;s time for us to form the strategic
partnerships necessary to compete successfully in this new
academic arena, and there&#146;s no better person to lead that
effort than our own Rick Skinner.&#148; </p>

<p>Georgia GLOBE will use technologies like the Internet and the
Web to provide Georgians &#151; especially non-traditional adult
students &#151; with expanded access to learning, particularly in
employment fields strategic to the state&#146;s economic
development. It is expected to become a highly visible packaging
and marketing arm for the System&#146;s on-line presence. </p>

<p>The new enterprise also will complement a reorganized
information technology infrastructure in the University System&#146;s
central office &#151; a refocusing designed to help implement
newly developed &#147;action items&#148; emanating from the Board
of Regents&#146; in-depth analysis of technology&#146;s impact on
higher education. Action items flowing from 16 technology
principles approved last month were presented today for first
reading, with final approval slated for the June meeting. </p>

<p>As the digital/electronic delivery system for the University
System of Georgia&#146;s education programs, GLOBE will support
the System&#146;s Intellectual Capital Partnership Program
(ICAPP) &#151; the highly successful economic development
program. GLOBE and ICAPP will complement each other to meet the
state&#146;s workforce and strategic economic development needs,
with GLOBE serving as a marketing conduit for credit courses and
degrees, as well as professional development courses and
workforce training. The self-standing unit will contract for
services within the University System and externally in the
higher education and information technology marketplace. The
expectation is that it will &#147;import and export world-class
learning resources&#148; nationally and internationally. </p>

<p>By September 1999, GLOBE &#151; in partnership with ICAPP and
state leaders &#151; will target key bachelor degrees for
development. Initial offerings will encompass high-demand
programs identified by ICAPP needs assessments, such as bachelor&#146;s
degrees in information technology/ engineering, teacher
education, business and general/integrative studies. By April
2000, GLOBE will partner with the University System&#146;s
two-year and four-year institutions to bring the &#147;core&#148;
of required freshmen and sophomore courses on-line, with junior
and senior courses for selected bachelor&#146;s degrees following
by April 2001. </p>

<p>Potential students and employers interested in gaining more
information on GLOBE&#146;s offerings can now access the program&#146;s
website online at: http://www.GeorgiaGLOBE.org. E-mail also may
be directed to Dr. Skinner at: <a
href="mailto:RichardSkinner@GeorgiaGLOBE.org">RichardSkinner@GeorgiaGLOBE.org</a>.
</p>

<p>A primary goal of the operation will be to expand the number
of Georgians earning bachelor&#146;s degrees. Only 4.5 percent of
Georgia&#146;s population is attending college compared to 5.3
percent nationally. This is partly the result of low high-school
graduation rates, but also low overall participation by working
adults. University System officials hope to significantly impact
the state&#146;s educational attainment levels by removing the
barriers of time and location that prohibit many working adults
from continuing their education and/or professional development. </p>

<p>In a related board activity, regents were briefed on the
organizational restructuring of the former Office of
Instructional and Informational Technology (OIIT) in the
University&#146;s System&#146;s Academic Affairs division. OIIT
will be restructured into two operating enterprises. One unit
will be focused on academic innovation, research and development,
and developing a leadership role in the technology revolution.
This unit will work with the institutions and their faculties to
develop the products (courses and degrees) for GLOBE. The other
will provide day-to-day information technology services,
including, among other duties, oversight of major administrative
computing, technical support, computer trouble-shooting and
maintenance of databases. </p>

<p>The regents academic-year emphasis on information technology
will culminate at the June board meeting, with final action on
the technology action items. </p>

<p>In the past three weeks, there has been an unusually large
amount of traffic at the intersection of Gentian Boulevard and
University Avenue. It would be difficult to miss the cause for
the traffic - a brand new Burger King, the 12th to open in the
Columbus and Phenix City area.</p>

<p>Why is this Burger King any different from the others? For
starters, the dining area holds about 200 people. Also, there is
a community room available for meetings - a great addition to any
college campus. Of course, no Burger King would be complete
without a playground. But how many CSU students have visited a
fast-food restaurant in Columbus with talking trash cans?</p>

<p>Described as &#147;architecturally unique&#148; by Schuster
Enterprises, INC., a Columbus-based family-owned franchise of
Burger King Corporation, this new restaurant has a &#147;train
station&#148; theme. This is in keeping with long-range Columbus
Consolidated government plans to build a trolley system to
service CSU and Flat Rock Park. Burger King&#146;s location,
overlooking the Manchester Expressway, will create a &#147;dynamic
new neighbor for Columbus State University and Peachtree Mall.&#148;</p>

<p>Columbus&#146; newest Burger King is designed to create a
&#147;neighborhood-friendly&#148; atmosphere. The large parking
lot allows those dining inside to be separated from the
drive-through traffic; anyone who has been to the new Chic-fil-a
will see that this design is quite nice. Conscious efforts were
made in regard to exterior lighting to ensure that Burger King
will provide a &#147;safe, welcoming environment at night.&#148;</p>

<p>The Schuster family is &#147;proud of the investment it has
made in the greater Columbus area since its beginning in 1967.&#148;
This new Burger King will have between 50 and 75 employees, with
a payroll of over $500,000 annually.</p>

<p>On July sixth, Hillary Clinton announced the formation of an
exploratory committee in the hope of garnering the open senate
seat in New York.</p>

<p>Throughout the past week Clinton has been travelling around
New York on a listening tour, gaining contact with the people of
the state and listening to their concerns. Part of the tour
consists of listening sessions with residents and media in which
a thirty minute round table discussion allows Clinton to hear
concerns about issues such as health care and education reform.</p>

<p>Clinton is unopposed in her pursuit of the democratic bid for
the seat. She is looking to take the place of Senator Patrick
Moynihan who is completing his term, and whose support she has
won. At the present time there are two people seeking the
Republican nomination, New York City Mayor, Rudolph Guiliani, and
Republican Rick Lazio.</p>

<p>Clinton&#146;s most adamant opposition comes from those people
that believe she should not run for the seat because she has
never been a state resident. However, there is no law preventing
her from running.</p>

<p>If Clinton runs she will be the first ever first lady to run
for an office.</p>

Thomaston, were among forty-seven contestants who competed for
the crown.</p>

<p>Teel and Vaughan were among the top ten semi-finalists and
Teel was a finalist, joining Andrea Bailey, Miss Southeast
Georgia ; Osjha Anderson, Miss University of Georgia; Yolanda
Davis, Miss Albany; and Sara Yankus, Miss Northwest Georgia. Teel
was announced as fourth runner-up and received a prize of $1,100
along with $800 for being named a finalist.</p>

<p>Emilie Edwards also received a Frances Frazier Memorial Talent
Award, given with a monetary sum of $400, awarded to
non-finalists talent winners.</p>

<p>The 1999 Miss Georgia was Osjha Anderson, whose platform was
based on people committing random acts of kindness towards
others.</p>

<p>Anderson will compete in the 1999 Miss America Pageant to be
held in Atlantic City, New Jersey on September 18. The show will
be televised on ABC.</p>

<p>Orientation for the fall semester is already underway. Our
wonderful Greek adviser, Kim Padgett, has been working diligently
to give every greek organization the opportunity to be
represented at each orientation. If your organization has missed
any of the orientations this past month, don&#146;t worry. There
will be three more orientations before fall semester starts, and
each organization is encouraged to participate.</p>

<p>This year things will run a little differently. Gone are the
days of concurrent sessions. Now each organization is asked to
have a display table set up in the morning and to participate in
an activity called Play Fair later on in the day. Play Fair is a
large ice breaker involving all of the students going through
orientation and any member of any student organization on campus.
This is a great opportunity to meet and mingle with the incoming
fall students, and it is so much fun!</p>

<p>If your organization is looking for new members, come to
orientation and meet the students.</p>

<p>Well, here we are, nearly finished with the Summer semester,
and getting out the one issue of the SABER you will get to enjoy
before Fall. To many of you, I owe a &#147;welcome,&#148; and to
the others, &#147;welcome back.&#148; The 1999-2000 school year
promises to be full of challenges and opportunities for all of
us, and I&#146;m sure it will be memorable.</p>

<p>I want to spend some time with this column discussing
something near and dear to everyone&#146;s heart: parking on
campus. There are some changes coming in this area, and it is
important that everyone get familiar with the system as quickly
as possible.</p>

<p>What will be happening very soon is a reduction in the number
of signs being used to designate parking areas, and a greater
reliance on a color-coded striping system in each parking lot.
The distinctions will be: white stripes indicate student parking;
blue stripes reserve handicapped spaces; and green stripes
delineate faculty/staff slots. Visitor spaces will continue to be
marked by signs, and are reserved for bonafide visitors to the
campus.</p>

<p>Some parking lots will be exclusively student lots; others
will be set aside for faculty and staff. The small lot between
Tucker Hall and Richards Hall will continue to be exclusively for
our handicapped drivers. You will also discover that some lots,
such as Lot #1, behind the Davidson Student Center, have sections
devoted to each class of driver, so it will be important to watch
the color-coding in those areas.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that parking is getting scarcer than before
(mostly due to the continuing growth of the university) and each
of us has to decide now that we&#146;re going into a &#147;voluntary
compliance mode&#148; to make the system work. The alternative is
not a pleasant one, as the fines levied for parking violations
will be double what they have been, effective August 10. That
means being found in the wrong parking area could cost $20,
rather than the $10 it set you back last year. Be part of the
solution, and not part of the problem, and you can avoid those
nasty little &#147;windshield gift certificates&#148; this
semester.</p>

<p>On June 17 the United States House of Representatives passed
an amendment to the juvenile crime bill giving states the
authority to place copies of the Ten Commandments in public
schools. The bill was introduced by Republican Robert Aderholt
and was passed by the House with a vote of 248-180. This
amendment is a result of the recent school massacre that occurred
at Columbine High School in Colorado. According to Georgia
Republican Bob Barr, &#147;if the Ten Commandments had been
posted at Columbine High School the massacre never would have
happened.&#148;</p>

<p>Do the members of the House not remember that small concept
that Americans like to call the separation of church and state?
Teachers must teach evolution from a strictly scientific point of
view, never allowing their opinions about the origin of man to
affect their students&#146; studies. Prayer of any kind has not
been allowed in schools in over forty years. And yet, our
congressional members now feel that they can impose religion on
students.</p>

<p>What about the students who do not practice Christianity,
those students that are Hindu, Buddhist, or Jewish? Even those
people that are agnostics or atheists have a belief in the fact
that they don&#146;t believe. What are these people going to
think when they walk into a school and have Christian values
thrown in their face.</p>

<p>Much of what society preaches today is the acceptance of other
cultures, religions, and beliefs. However, this act is a blatant
disregard of all that parents try to teach their children. It is
not within the rights of the state or the national government to
administer religion to children- it is a choice made by the
family and the individual.</p>

<p>I do not believe that a plaque of the Ten Commandments would
have stopped the shooting that occurred in Colorado, nor will it
stop any other event like it from happening across the United
States or in any other part of the world. People will not be
stopped by a piece of paper; they are stopped by their own will.
The House should realize that, for as much as they may try, they
can not stop a human spirit.</p>

<hr size="1" noshade color="#0066FF">

<p>Columbus has always been a strong catapult for talented
musicians, and I think we just found a new one.</p>

<p>Get used to this name - Seth Burnette. Seth comes from a
strong musical family and has loved music since early childhood.
His father and blues/rock musician, Gary Burnette, taught him how
to play electric bass when he was in high school. Today, Seth is
22 years old, and has been experimenting with electronic music
for nearly two years now. So where does he get it from?</p>

<p>Seth looks to his father as a strong influence, personally and
in his music. Seth also credits Brian Transeau with being an
influence to his music. &#147;He brings some heart and a sense of
the complexity of classical pieces to dance music,&#148; Burnette
said of Transeau. Seth also looks to Paul Van Dyke for musical
knowledge, because he &#147;is able to orchestrate songs that cry
out with emotion and feeling without the need for any vocalizing
lyrics to direct the listener.&#148;</p>

<p>So all this being said, Seth Burnette appears to have great
potential. Then I listened to his album, and now I know he has
great potential. The working title for the album is &#147;Space,
Time, and Volume,&#148; and all of this is under the guise of
&#147;Casimir Effect.&#148;</p>

<p>I recently spoke with Seth and asked him what he thought his
album sounded like.</p>

<p>SB: &#147;I try to bring the beauty of trance and the dance
floor friendliness of breakbeat together, so that one track might
be nice to groove to while reading or driving, and the next might
force you to either put down your book and dance or drive faster.&#148;</p>

<p>BH: Where did the name &#147;Space, Time &amp; Volume&#148;
come from?</p>

<p>SB: &#147;I was just thinking one day about how to mix two
different instruments together that appear in the same EQ
bandwidth, such as a kick drum and a deep bass line, without
interference or cancellation of either one. I was thinking that
they either had to be in different spatial locations relative to
the speakers (i.e., one panned left, the other center), timed
differently</p>

<p>(as in kick, bass line, kick), or given distinctly different
volume levels to stand out from each other. Space, Time, and
Volume seemed to fit with the physics reference that &#145;Casimir
Effect&#146; was taken from.&#148;</p>

<p>Ok, so Seth knows what he is talking about, and believe me,
listening to it is easier than trying to follow where it came
from.</p>

<p>Every musician has the dream of &#147;making it big.&#148;
Seth Burnette has what it takes to do just that. So, when he
does, what would he want to do then? So I asked Seth a question
that I was curious about.</p>

<p>BH: If you were ever given the opportunity to play with a
famous musician, who would that person be?</p>

<p>SB: &#147;Tori Amos - because even though I&#146;d feel
musically inferior, she seems to be such a naturally talented
musician and all-around artist. I mean, that woman can really get
an emotion across.&#148;</p>

<p>BH: What is your favorite track on &#147;Space, Time, and
Volume&#148; and why?</p>

<p>SB: &#147;My favorite track on my album right now is &#147;Curvature&#148;
because I feel I came close to achieving at least something
approximating beauty, and it&#146;s got a good groove.&#148;</p>

<p>Can we see Seth play live anywhere yet? Well, no, not yet.
But, on Wednesdays and Fridays you can go down to the Chickasaw
and request for the DJ to play Casimir Effect (or just &#147;Seth,&#148;
he&#146;ll know who you mean).</p>

<p>For those who like to know a little about an artist before
getting into them, here is just enough to get you started on Seth
Burnette and &#147;Casimir Effect.&#148; Everybody has one, so I
asked Seth about his most embarrassing moment. He told me a
story: &#147;In second grade I was attending a new school, and
for Halloween I dressed as Dracula for the day (my old school let
us dress up on Halloween). To my horror I found, right as my mom
was dropping me off, that none of the other kids had dressed up
for the occasion. Needless to say, I didn&#146;t even get out of
the car. I made her take me straight home to change. I don&#146;t
think anyone actually saw me, but I was embarrassed nonetheless.&#148;
Oops.</p>

<p>And to close this small look at Seth Burnette and Casimir
Effect, here is some stuff we should all know - his favorite food
is sushi, he&#146;s lived in Columbus since he was 5, he is an
only child, he is married to Stephanie Burnette, he works at
Wherehouse Music in Peachtree Mall right now, he really wants to
make it in the music business, and he would like to be involved
in getting a true dance music scene started here in Columbus (&#147;you
know, something with more than 10 people involved.&#148;)</p>

<p>For those interested, a Seth has a flyer available at Riff&#146;s
with information about his music and his website. Seth can be
contacted at &lt;casimirburnette@mindspring.com&gt;.</p>

For those of you reading this, I guess your summer could be

were still going strong?</p>

<p>So anyway, I actually went to the Cher/Lauper shindig because
my favorite person (and girlfriend), Jenny, wanted to go. Of
course, I didn&#146;t tell her that is the only reason I wanted
to go. I kind of wanted to see Cyndi Lauper - I&#146;ve had a
crush on her ever since I saw the movie &#147;Goonies.&#148; So,
Cyndi was great - green hair and all.</p>

<p>Lauper ran through a slower, more up to date sounding list of
a few of her more popular hits - &#147;Girls Just Want To Have
Fun,&#148; &#147;She-Bop,&#148; and &#147;True Colors,&#148; just
to name a few. After she was done, I was pretty much ready to go,
but the three ladies I was with came to see Cher - so I was
stuck. Thirty minutes and a rain storm later, Cher hit the stage
and breezed through a list of songs dating back as early as 1975.
The show, which was more of a dramatic performance, with costumed
dancers, theatric scenery and all, pretty much went in
chronological order throughout. The Jesse James song, &#147;If I
Could Turn Back Time,&#148; and her newest hit &#147;Believe,&#148;
were among a few songs she played. My personal favorite was her
own version of &#147;Walking In Memphis&#148;, which is less
popular than the Mark Cohn version.</p>

<p>My point is - I&#146;m glad I stayed. I am truly convinced
that I saw a legend on stage that night.</p>

<p>Now, on to the really good show. I made this trek without the
lovely Jenny. Much to her disadvantage, she was born in 1980, and
therefore does not truly appreciate good 80&#146;s rock and roll.
She&#146;ll learn - hopefully. And speaking of good 80&#146;s
rock and roll - a tour called &#147;Summer Jam&#148; is just that
- rock and roll. Four bands and five hours of music. L.A. Guns
hit the stage first, and they were pretty good. Pretty loud too.
They got people on their feet and dancing at 7:00 p.m. For a
concert in the daylight it wasn&#146;t bad. 8:00 p.m. rolled
around and brought Great White along for the ride. They were
impressive. &#147;Rock Me,&#148; and &#147;Once Bitten Twice Shy&#148;
were crowd pleasers and proved once again that rock and roll is
still cool.</p>

<p>Nine o&#146;clock came pretty quickly, and Ratt came along
with it. It took 30 seconds for myself, and the people with me
(Jack and Sarah) to realize that not even a decade has made Ratt
any better than they were. So we retreated to the outer grounds
of Lakewood and waited. And waited. And waited. Ratt played
forever. Finally they finished. We then felt safe enough to go
back into the arena - all the bad music was gone.</p>

<p>It was nearly 10:15 p.m. and time for the band of all bands to
play. It was time for Poison! All of a sudden, there they were.
Bret Michaels, C.C. Deville, Bobby Dall, and Rikki Rockett - the
original line-up, back together and better than ever. You name it
and they played it - &#147;Look What The Cat Dragged In,&#148;
&#147;Unskinny Bop,&#148; &#147;Every Rose Has Its Thorn,&#148;
&#147;Talk Dirty To Me,&#148; the Loggins and Messina song &#147;Your
Momma Don&#146;t Dance,&#148; and the Kiss anthem &#147;Rock and
Roll All Night.&#148; After nearly two hours of great music,
shiny clothes, big hats, and, did I mention great music, the show
was over. Just like that, as quick as it came, my flashback to
the 80&#146;s was over. But hey, there is good news! Poison is
working on a new album - yes, rock and roll is alive and well -
and the Scorpions and Motley Crue are playing Lakewood in August!</p>

<p>American Pie</p>

<p>This is yet another coming-of-age comedy about a group of
friends at the end of their senior year. I thought this was going
to be like all the other &#147;end of the senior year&#148;
movies, where the friends end up making a cheesy pact to stay
&#147;friends forever.&#148; Well, &#147;American Pie&#148;
surprised me, and went one up on the cheesy pact. In fact, there
is a pact in this film, but it is a pact between the guys to lose
their virginity by prom night. In their flailing attempts to
fulfill this mission, they learn a few surprising, hilarious and
often humbling discoveries about themselves, each other, love and
the ever mysterious opposite sex. The movie is not all cheese;
most of the movie is disgustingly funny and at it&#146;s finest,
crude. Go see it.</p>

<p>Arlington Road</p>

<p>Ok, here&#146;s the scoop on this movie: Michael Faraday is a
recently widowed college history professor and he lives with his
ten-year-old son Grant in Washington, DC. Michael&#146;s wife,
Leah, was an FBI agent and was killed in the line of duty. Her
memory continues to haunt both father and son. Michael and Grant
become friends with the Langs, the new family in the
neighborhood. Oliver and Cheryl Lang go out of their way to bring
Michael into their lives. Soon, Grant and the Hunt&#146;s son
Brady become very close friends.<br>
Everything seems to be back to normal for the Faraday family,
until, piece by piece, the plot falls into place. The Lang family
is not the family you want living next door to you. This plot,
like my fellow writer Wes Carroll stated, is very similar to that
of the movie &#147;Blown Away.&#148; Well, for the record, the
two movies are completely different. &#147;Arlington Road&#148;
brings with it a plot twist that cannot be imagined, suspense
that has not been matched, and acting that is worthy of an Oscar.
&#147;Arlington Road&#148; stars Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, Joan
Cusack, and Hope Davis.</p>

<p>Stigmata</p>

<p>Ok, this movie is not out yet, I think it hits theaters in
late August, but here is what I do know about it. A young woman
becomes the victim of brutal assaults by an unseen attacker, and
the spiritual implications of the incidents drive a Vatican
official to send a priest to investigate. After witnessing her
attacks for himself, the priest becomes more concerned with
saving her life than debunking her claims. To simply put it, the
woman is being attacked by demons and her wounds are similar to
those experienced by Jesus during the crucifixion. This movie
looks to be, well, creepy.</p>

<p>Why is Mia Hamm so popular? Is it because she is attractive?
Yes. Is this only the only reason? No. In my opinion, Mia Hamm is
popular because she exhibits qualities that we all wish our
mothers, daughters, sisters and wives had, but unfortunately most
lack.</p>

<p>For starters, she is extremely confident. Anybody who starts
out doing shampoo commercials and ends up telling Michael Jordan
that she can do anything better than he can automatically earns
my respect.</p>

<p>She also knows what she wants. Any guy will tell you this is a
major plus. She wanted to become the world&#146;s best women&#146;s
soccer player in the world - she has. She wanted an Olympic Gold
medal - she got it. She wanted to become the most recognizable
soccer player since Pele&#146; - she will be (if she isn&#146;t
already).</p>

<p>Finally, her priorities are in line. She could have made a
large sum of money in Europe, yet she chose to go to college and
stay in the United States.</p>

<p>Mia Hamm is popular because she is the girl next door. She
went out and achieved her dreams. Mia can be summed up in one
simple quote. When asked what her greatest accomplishment would
or could be, she simply stated, &#147;To have inspired a little
girl to achieve everything she ever dreamed about. That would be
the greatest thing in the world.&#148;</p>

<p>May every girl grow up to believe like Mia Hamm.</p>

<hr size="1" noshade color="#0066FF">

<p>The National Basketball League has once again proved that it
supports a personality contest rather than an athletic game. Karl
Malone winning MVP over Tim Duncan was a terrible decision. This
goes to show that whining and complaining overshadows politeness
and selflessness.</p>

<p>The league needs to focus more on the quiet &#147;I play for
the love of the game&#148; guys, and less on the whiners and
coach chokers. When we overlook the Tim Duncan&#146;s, Ray Allen&#146;s,
and Tom Gugliotta&#146;s, sooner or later they will lose the love
and we will be stuck with the Iverson&#146;s, Sprewell&#146;s,
and Barkley&#146;s.</p>

<p>Players should take an example from David Robinson. He has
long been the star of his team, but knew the way to a ring. Let
Tim Duncan be the man. He did so never complaining and always
giving a maximum effort. Maybe others will learn from this
(hint-hint: Ewing, O&#146;Neal, and Penny). </p>
