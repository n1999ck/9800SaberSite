<p><font size="5"><strong>Professor commits suicide on campus<br>
</strong></font><font size="2"><strong>Bridgette Brumbaugh /
Editor-in-Chief</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">Monday morning several faculty, staff and
students were in shock about the suicide of Psychology and
Sociology Professor, David M. Centa. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The County Coroner pronounced Dr. Centa dead at
the scene at 9:30 a.m.. Official cause of death was a gunshot
wound to the head. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Police are not suspicious of foul play. There
is a current investigation as to why Dr. Centa did this. More
will be known in a few days. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dr. Centa missed his 8:00 a.m. Psychology 1101
class, and later his 9:00 a.m. Psychology 4205 class. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">A student from the Psychology 4205 class went
to the secretary to inquire about his absence. His car was on
campus, so the student and secretary went to his office. They
found him dead and called Public Safety. A nurse was also called,
but nothing could be done. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dr. Centa is survived by his daughter and
former wife. His former wife was on campus Monday morning and
witnesses say that she was very distraught. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dr. Centa had been teaching at CSU since 1970.
He was recently been accepted to go to Russia on a Fulbright
grant. He was also been nominated twice for Educator of the Year.
</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dr. Centa had a wide range of international
experiences as well. From 1987-1995 he took four trips to Mexico
to learn the culture. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">In 1991 he was awarded the CSU grant to
participate in the History and Architecture courses at England. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">He spent ten days in Japan in 1993 while his
daughter was attending school there. In 1995 he received a
Fulbright Visiting Professorship to India for 100 days. On
February 23, he wrote that this trip helped him teach students
better and that he left India with the feeling that he had
contributed to them as much as he had gained. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">In 1998 he spent 10 days in the Amazon rain
forest in Peru.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In his application process to qualify for the
Fulbright grant, Dr. Centa wrote, &#147;Upon refection, it is
difficult to imagine teaching without these experiences. I
welcome opportunities to explore other cultures. I have learned
how to maximize the quality of the exposure to another
culture.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Counseling Center will be set up to help
faculty and students deal with the situation. Various programs
will also be available. They can be contacted at 568-2233.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Chief Jasper Cook wants students to know there
is no concern for the safety of the students. This was an
isolated incident and students should not worry about being
harmed on campus.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Another professor will take over the Dr.
Centa&#146;s courses. </font></p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Sexual Assault reaches everyone<br>
</strong></font><font size="2"><strong>Anonymous</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">-A Personal Account</font></p>

<p><font size="4">When I was first assigned to write this
article, I thought it would be a short, concise piece - who,
what, when, where, why. The story would have read, &#147;A
Candlelight March to commemorate Sexual Assault Education and
Prevention Week will be held March 24 at 6:30 p.m. beginning at
CSU Parking Lot #11. This function is sponsored by CSU, Columbus
Rape Crisis and the Russell County Tri-Aid. Everyone is invited
to support this event.&#148; But my article can&#146;t stop
there.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I never thought I would have an affiliation
with a sexual assault group. I thought nothing like that could
ever happen to me.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">On St. Patrick&#146;s night, I went to a local
bar where I know many people including the management and wait
staff. I met several friends there and had a great time. But I
can&#146;t account for the last hour and a half of the night.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It seems that I finished someone else&#146;s
beer that had been laced with a date-rape drug. I felt sick at
first and then don&#146;t know what happened after that. I was
lucky, though, and was with friends who took care of me. What
happened to the person who drank the first half of the beer
though?</font></p>

<p><font size="4">According to Major Mott of the Columbus Police
Department, he hasn&#146;t read any reports this year of someone
ingesting a date-rape drug, called &#147;G&#148; or
&#147;Ruffie&#148;. He did state, however, that only one in ten
rapes are reported and this would fall under this category.
People are too embarrassed or afraid others will not believe them
so they just don&#146;t report the crime.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I usually keep my beer in my sight but had to
use a Solo cup that evening. Of course, the wide-mouth container
made it an easy target for someone to drop something into. I now
know how easily someone can take advantage of you and how quickly
this can happen. I had many apologies to make the next day for
things I have no recollection of happening.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Please come and support this Candlelight March.
You don&#146;t know if or when you or a friend may be a victim.
The more aware the public is, the less chance we have of being
violated.</font></p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Woodall building undergoes facelift<br>
</strong></font><font size="2"><strong>Lisa Grant / Staff Writer</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Woodall Building is currently undergoing a
major facelift. This building, that houses the Computer Center
and formerly housed the Academic S</font><font size="3">upport C</font><font
size="4">enter, is nearing completion of the renovations that
began in January.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Hal Gibson, Director of Plant Operations, says
the renovations have been needed for a while. He says, &#147;The
Woodall project is one in a series of projects over the next
couple of years.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Tucker Building was recently redone and now
houses the Academic Support Center. Woodall will expand the
Computer Center; basically doubling it&#146;s space. Also, more
offices will be included to suit faculty and programmers. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&#147;To give everyone more breathing
space,&#148; says Gibson. Gibson also says the new space and look
will be more suitable to the needs of students and faculty.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Working with requested state funds, earmarked
especially for renovation improvements, Gibson, Ray Underwood, a
local architect, and Bill Johnson, Director of the Computer
Center, developed the plan to revamp the building. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Phillip Clark, Head of Maintenance says,
&#147;We are making good progress. We are well ahead of where I
thought we should be.&#148; He says that the building should be
ready to occupy soon. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Gibson says that he is pleased with the
interior facelift. &#147;We are trying to add color [and] jazz
things up a bit,&#148; he says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">According to Dr. Craig Lloyd, Professor of
History and Director of CSU Archives, the building was one of the
first four constructed on this campus. Construction occurred
between the fall of 1961 and 1962. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The building housed both the college library
and administrative offices when the campus opened to students in
January, 1963. The building was named in honor of Simon Schwob,
one of the earliest local benefactors of the College, in November
1962. The administrative offices moved to the Richards Building
(named in May 1969) which was opened in Sept. 1966. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The library moved with the Schwob name to its
present location in September 1975. In December 1975, the
building was named in honor of W. C. Woodall, a longtime devotee
of Columbus as journalist, historian, and school board member. At
that time, the building was renovated for classrooms, faculty
offices, and computer center. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The next big project will be the Howard
Building. This project is now on the state list of improvements
for next year. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4">This week is Sexual Assault Education and
Prevention Week on campus. The week&#146;s activities were funded
by the Counciling Center on campus, Columbus Rape Crisis and D.
Abbott Turner Mini-grant. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The week includes many activities for students
who wish to support this effort. Students participating in the
event receive certificate of attendanace/participation for the
event or credit in select classes. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The student organization diplay competition was
held Monday. Displays are still available for viewing in the
downstairs lobby of the Davidson Student Center.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Winners of the display contest for Sexual
Assault Awareness Week are; first place, Delta Zeta; second
place, Student Programming Council; third place, Phi Mu Kappa.</font></p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Foundation encourages kidney function
testing<br>
</strong></font><font size="2"><strong>Press Release from the
National Kidney Foundation</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">Atlanta, GA &#151; Kidney disease is an
epidemic in Georgia, where 8,000 individuals must undergo kidney
dialysis three times each week, and each dialysis treatment
session typically lasts five hours. Over 650 Georgia residents
are awaiting kidney transplants, yet only one in three will
receive the kidney they so desperately need.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The incidence of life-threatening end-stage
kidney disease is increasing at a rate of more than eight percent
per year. Risk factors include high blood pressure, diabetes, and
having a relative with kidney disease. Statistics show that
African-Americans are four times as likely to have kidney disease
than Caucasians. Learn how to keep your kidneys healthy and learn
if you are at risk. You can make a difference.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Become an organ donor. Organs from living
donors now account for almost one-third of all kidney transplants
performed in the United States. Donating a kidney to a relative
or even a stranger whose own kidneys have failed poses very
little risk to the donor and may significantly increase the
chances that more people on waiting lists will get the organs
they need to survive. &#147;Living donors&#148; have few surgical
complications, little pain, and relatively short hospital stays.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Kidney disease often may be silent for many
years until it reaches an advanced stage. &#147;For this reason,
it is important to make sure your doctor includes tests of your
kidney function as part of your regular physical
examination,&#148; says Joel D. Kopple, MD, president of the
National Kidney Foundation. &#147;These tests should be
considered as essential a part of an annual checkup as blood
sugar, blood cholesterol and blood pressure measurements,&#148;
Dr. Kopple continues. Recent research has shown that the presence
of albumin in the urine considerably increases the risk of heart
disease - the number one cause of death in the U.S. Dr. Kopple
recommends an annual urine test for the presence of a protein
called albumin, which can help identify people who are at risk
for developing kidney disease before they notice any symptoms.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The warning signs of kidney disease include:
urinating more often, especially at night; swelling of the hands
and feet and puffiness around the eyes; burning or difficulty
during urination; passage of bloody-appearing urine; and pain in
the small of the back, just below the ribs.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">If you have any of these signs, see your doctor
right away. When kidney disease is detected early, treatments
such as dietary modification and careful control of high blood
pressure or diabetes may help to prevent or slow the progression
of kidney damage. When kidney disease progresses to total kidney
failure, treatments such as dialysis or a transplant are needed
to maintain life.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The National Kidney Foundation of Georgia urges
you to learn more about your kidneys and to get regular checkups
that include tests for blood pressure, blood sugar, urine protein
and kidney function. For more information about the kidneys and
kidney disease, contact the National Kidney Foundation of Georgia
at (404) 248-1315 or toll-free in Georgia at 1-800-633-2339.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The National Kidney Foundation of Georgia is
dedicated to preventing kidney and urinary tract diseases,
improving the health and well-being of individuals and families
affected by these diseases and increasing the availability of all
organs for transplantation.</font></p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Within a Room<br>
</strong></font><font size="2"><strong>Leslie Maxwell / Columnist</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">By the time this column is printed, Spring
Break memories will already be jumbled in our minds with tests,
projects, and the million and one factoids that we have the
pleasure of absorbing in college. I hope that all of you had a
vacation as enjoyable as mine. Early Saturday morning, I left
college and Columbus behind and headed for inner-city Houston,
TX, with seven other members of the BSU. We climbed into the van
without knowing exactly what to expect for the week, and 14 hours
later, we arrived at Gano Mission Center, in the &#147;bad
part&#148; of Houston&#146;s Northside. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">We spent Sunday getting acclimated to our
surroundings and buying supplies for the week. Then, on Monday,
we got our first job assignments. Some of the guys were
immediately put to work digging a ditch to bury some telephone
cable in the parking lot. They also had to find the locations of
an underground pipe. Fortunately, they found the pipe, but
unfortunately, they broke it in the process. Then they had to dig
some more in order to fix the pipe. (And you&#146;re thinking,
&#147;What a great way to spend spring break&#148;). </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The girls, including myself, got put to work
disassembling and moving bunk-beds, then painting a large dining
hall. I think the wall painted one girl as much as she painted
it. In any case, she was quite blue by the end of the day. We
spent our nights relaxing, playing games, and doing Bible
studies. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">But all of these activities were only part of
the reason we went to Houston. We also had a chance to help
people of all ages in the poverty-stricken inner city. On one
day, we played with children in an after-school program, and one
night participated in a teen club that is designed to keep
teenagers off the rough city streets.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Out of all the programs we helped with, the
food pantry and the senior adult luncheon were my favorites. For
both of these ministries, the people receiving food have to be
interviewed each time they come. The neighborhood around Gano is
primarily Hispanic, and most of the adults who come to the
mission speak only Spanish. This gave two of the other group
members and myself a chance to practice our fledgling Spanish
skills. I interviewed people for two days, getting financial
information and finding out what they wanted from the available
food list. My Spanish was okay, but I never found anyone who knew
a translation for &#147;grits.&#148; I talked to one homeless man
who lifted my spirits much more than I lifted his, and talking
with the senior adults was wonderful. They were all so amazed
that we had given up our vacation to work at Gano.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">By the time we got back to Columbus, we were
all exhausted, but glad that we had made the trip. I decided to
write my column about our trip to remind everyone how great it
can be help others. We might have worked during our vacation, but
it was worth it to know that we helped a lot of people who depend
on the mission centers for food, clothing, and spiritual needs.
So next time you have the opportunity to help someone, whether it
is for a week, a day, or for five minutes, do it. You won&#146;t
be disappointed. The world needs a little more selfless kindness
these days. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&#147;Give yourselves a hand!&#148;
Entertainers are always saying that. I think they just love
applause, in any form. I&#146;d like to say &#147;Give yourselves
a hand,&#148; too. The difference is that I mean it as &#147;Give
yourselves some assistance, aid, help, or whatever you want to
call it.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">You can do that, you know, by joining the
Department of Public Safety in our crime prevention/detection/
investigation mission. Now, I don&#146;t mean you&#146;re all
going to be deputized and issued all the paraphernalia that goes
along with being a certified peace officer. What I mean is that
each of you, whether student, staff member or faculty, can add
your eyes and ears to those of our regular officers and get
involved in the maintenance of law and order here in the
University community.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A lot of you are thinking, &#147;Man, I
ain&#146;t no snitch,&#148; but that&#146;s not all that goes
into taking a proactive role in crime prevention and reporting.
Whether you grew up thinking of the police as Pigs, Fuzz, or the
PoPo, you have to admit, if you&#146;re honest with yourself,
that the police role is a necessary one, and, for the most part,
is carried out well. The problem is, we can&#146;t be everywhere,
and we can&#146;t see everything. We need folks like you to take
responsibility for their own little corner of the world.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">What I mean by that is for you to remain alert
and aware of your surroundings, report strange or suspicious
activity or persons, and assist the police when they ask
questions in an attempt to locate property or people. You may not
have been the victim, but you could be next time, if you
don&#146;t get involved, NOW. Which brings me to another point.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Very soon, if you follow announcements in The
Saber and other campus publications, you will read about a system
very much like the &#147;Crime Stoppers&#148; you have all seen
in local newspapers and on TV. This system, called &#147;Silent
Witness,&#148; will allow you to e-mail information to our
department 24 hours a day, seven days a week, while avoiding the
sometimes-awkward &#147;personal contact&#148; with an officer.
As a responsible member of the University community, I know
you&#146;ll want to do that.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">You&#146;ll be &#147;giving yourselves a
hand&#148; at curbing crime and I&#146;ll be able to say
&#147;give yourselves a hand,&#148; meaning applause, for your
civic consciousness and mature responsibility.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Ben Wells is one of the Saber&#146;s greatest
assests. He takes on enormous responsibility as the layout person
for both the print and online issues of the Saber. He has been at
the Saber for three years.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Aside from working with the paper, Wells is
busy in many other campus activities. He has been involved with
the SGA for two years as a senator. Wells also maintains the new
website for SGA.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Although he is a computer science major, Wells
spends much of his time involved in music department activities.
He is presently rehearsing for his part in the opera, &#147;The
Merry Widow&#148;, which the music department will present on
April 29th and May 1st. Wells plays the part of Raoul St. Brioche
in the opera and says he is excited about participating in the
classic. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&#147;This role will give me an opportunity to
play a character very different from my own personality. I will
be playing a boisterous Frenchman, so, it will be fun in that
respect,&#148; Wells says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wells also recently won his category at the
NATS (National Association of Teachers of Singing) competition.
This is a vocal solo contest in which he competed with all other
junior men in Georgia. He won his category at NATS last year as
well.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wells is the interim pianist for his home
church, Edgewood Presbyterian. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Despite his talent as a musician, Wells hopes
to start a career in computer programming, specializing in
graphical user interface (GUI) design after graduation. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&#147;Even though I thoroughly enjoy music, I
could not picture myself making a career out of performing or
teaching. I am positive, however, that whatever road my career
takes, music will always be a part of my life,&#148; Wells
states.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wells, 21, is the oldest of two. His sister,

<p><font size="4">Pennie Arrington, who works in Instructional
Technical Services, is the third nominee for Outstanding Faculty
Female in honor of Women&#146;s History Month.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Arrington is the Instruction Resource
Specialist, which makes her responsible for getting the
audio/visual equipment into the classrooms. She has been in that
department for 24 years and has worked with most of the
department staff for 13 years. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">A few years ago, she was honored for her work
by being named Employee of the Month. With this award, she was
given the use of a special parking space for a month.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Arrington says God is her driving force. He is
the most important figure in her life and she is very active in
her church. She feels her most important activity has been
praying for the sick in the hospital. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Family is also important to Pennie. Her
husband, who is a Certified Public Accountant, has been very
supportive of her work. She also has two children and two
grandchildren whom are all significant in her life. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Pennie Arrington feels honored to have been
chosen as an important woman on campus. She says she enjoys her

<p><font size="5"><strong>In your face! with Stephanie Adams</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">Women should rule the world<br>
Part I</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&#147;Every time a girl reads a womenless
history she learns she is worth less.&#148; -Myra and David
Sadker</font></p>

<p><font size="4">What exactly is Women&#146;s History Month? The
women&#146;s rights movement began when women&#146;s rights
leaders discovered their own secondary status while working to
abolish slavery. This month is an opportunity for us to honor the
many women who have served this country as doctors, factory
workers, soldiers and mothers, etc. More importantly it is a time
to be proud to be a woman. For centuries women have been treated
like secondary citizens. We were denied the basic rights that men
took for granted: the right to vote, the right to own property,
the right to our own opinion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">So, how do I feel about women&#146;s history
month? I believe it is a step in the right direction, but it is
by no means the crowning moment in our struggle for equality. I
consider myself to be a southern feminist. Southern women have to
be strong yet docile at the same time. We have to be able to
manage a career, bake cookies, run a carpool, and most
importantly ... take care of our man. Well, I say no more. I want
men to realize that the old south is dead and, contrary to
popular belief, will not rise again. (This is not to say that
women in other parts of the country do not suffer the same type
of discrimination as we do in the south.) My name is not sugar or
darlin&#146; and I will not go get you something to drink!</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Why have women struggled for so long? Bottom
line - women have consistently been raised to believe they are
inferior. Society has contributed to confirming this lower
status, but we really learn from our mothers how we as women are
supposed to behave. They in turn learned from their mothers. It
is a sad cycle that has been occurring for thousands of years. I
am fortunate to have a mother who wants me to break the cycle.
She has raised me to want a career of my own, a life of my own,
and she has instilled in me the knowledge that I do not need a
man to be a complete individual.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Why does the idea of strong women scare so many
people? The religious right will have us believe that the
depletion of family values is largely due to women being in the
work place. Many men believe that women are inferior to them in
the ways of job skills when really they just don&#146;t want to
have to work harder to compete with the women who are taking
their jobs. For the record, I believe that men and women have
equal intelligence. Either sex is capable of accomplishing equal

<p><font size="4">However, men and women are different. Neither
is superior to the other, but each sex has talents that the other
sex doesn&#146;t. We communicate differently. We use logic
differently. It should be very obvious why women are on the rise
right now. After being suppressed all these years, women are
sweeping the nation like a fresh breeze. Women are beginning to
influence the world in areas that have been, until recently,
inaccessible. In a world that has been run by men for centuries,
an opposing force has finally begun to surface. Hey, you guys
have done a great job. Depletion of the ozone layer, killing the
rainforest, WAR, AFTER WAR, AFTER WAR ... Men have made the
decisions of how this country, this world, should live and breath
for too long.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">On April 1 the Council of Deans will review
CSU&#146;s attendance policy. The current policy now is vague and
penalties, if any, for poor attendance are generally left up to
the discretion of individual professors or departments. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Joel Judah, President of SGA, says it is highly
probable that the attendance issue will be raised in the next SGA
meeting.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">There are those who feel the issue should be
put to rest by simply doing away with an attendance policy
altogether. Mr. Kees, Assistant Vice President, says that option
will be considered at the Council of Deans meeting.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">There are several problems with the present
policy, or lack of policy, not the least of which involves
extracurricular activities. Many students are involved in
activities on campus, which force them to be away during class
time. Two groups that come to mind are music students and
athletes. Some professors consider absences involving school
activities as excused absences, other do not. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Athletes have similar concerns, especially
those on scholarships. The administration and coaching staff
encourages students to participate in team functions, including
games that take place out of town. If athletes do not participate
they could lose their athletic scholarship. If the athlete
participates, he or she may miss class. Does the student fail if
too many classes are missed? It depends on the professor. And how
many classes are too many? It depends on the professor.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">As always, there is another side to the coin.
If athletes and music students are excused, then what about night
students many of who have children or jobs that may lead them to
miss class? If other groups can be excuse for school sanctioned
events then what about night students? Aren&#146;t they just as
important? </font></p>

<p><font size="4">I&#146;ve had both extremes of professors,
those who take attendance very seriously and those who
couldn&#146;t care less. Dr. Bill Edwards in the Communications
program goes so far as to have seating chart. He explained that
he does this to make it easier to learn names as well as take
roll. One thing is certain, he takes attendance seriously. Other
professors feel it is not the professors&#146; place to baby-sit
students, most of whom are adults. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">I can see both sides to this. Inevitably, doing
away with an attendance policy would cause some students to take
advantage of the free time. I&#146;ve been sick much of this
semester and missed many days myself. My professors are humans;
they understand sickness, children, demanding jobs and other
problems that legitimately keep people out of school. Taking roll
for most professors seems more like a hassle than anything else
and many would rather get down to the business of teaching class.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">So, if the attendance policy is done away with,
will grades over all go down? My guess is that the institution
can bet on grades going down if students aren&#146;t penalized
for coming to class, at first. I also believe that students will
get used to it and grades will come back up after everyone
realizes that it is hard to pass a class you don&#146;t show up
for. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">There are those students who can pass without
showing up for class and if they can then I think they should be
left alone. If no one is showing up to a certain professor&#146;s
class and everyone is still passing, then maybe the professor is
not as indispensable as once thought. If the professor is not
even needed for students to pass the class, then the students are
getting their money&#146;s worth. After all, they paid for both
the book and the class.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The students pay to be at the university.
Shouldn&#146;t it be their choice whether they show up or not?
There should be a penalty for not showing up for class. The
penalty should be self-administered; it should be the bad grade
for not keeping up. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">March 14,1999<br>
Re: Saber Article &#147;Unhappy and gay!!&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dear Editor,</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I read with interest the article about the gay
and Christian issue. I agree with the author&#146;s opinion that
there are groups of Christians that give the entire Christian
movement a bad name. As a matter of fact, these groups have been
so vocal that many people believe the idea of someone proclaiming
to be gay and a Christian is an oxymoron.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The truth, is Jesus never condemned
homosexuals. Not one of the 10 Commandments mention
homosexuality. But many people don&#146;t realize that. While
there are a small number of verses out of the entire Bible that
seem to condemn homosexuals, there are many more that condemn
dishonesty, murder, hypocrisy, etc. Even so, when you take into
consideration the culture and history of the times, and read
those supposedly &#147;condemning&#148; verses in the context of
the entire chapter or story, a much different meaning comes
across.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">This idea is shared by many learned Bible
scholars. There are many churches that lovingly accept gay and
lesbians within their membership without requiring them to
change. Here in Columbus, Family of God Metropolitan Community
Church is such a church. We open our doors to all people without
exception- We want people to be free to be the unique individual
God created them to be, whether that is gay or straight or
in-between, fat or thin or in-between, white, black, red, or
yellow, or in-between.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">We are part of a denomination that was founded
in 1968 by the Reverend Troy Perry, because gay and lesbians
could not find a church home where they could be themselves and
worship God openly. Several times throughout the year we sponsor
a workshop dealing with the subject of Homosexuality and the
Bible.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Throughout history the church universal has
been guilty of oppressing one group or another and using
different Bible passages to justify their position. Next month we
will be studying this very issue at our Bible Study, call
321-9202 for more information. You may also reach us on line at </font><a

    <li><font size="4">Is it just me or are these prices at the
        new &#147;Healthy Deli&#148; in Howard mighty expensive?
        I got a sandwich (just a sandwich) and a drink and I
        spent near to five bucks! I can go get an all-you-can-eat
        Chinese buffet for that! The place looks great, it&#146;s
        nice to have a place you can sit and eat lunch and they
        food is good, but damn! We are poor starving college
        students here. Give us a break! I don&#146;t have time to
        run around looking for somewhere to eat, so this place is
        very convenient for me. I don&#146;t like to always bring
        lunch and I can&#146;t go home for lunch as I live an
        hour away. Why must more profit be made directly from
        students? I don&#146;t think the cafeteria is even this
        expensive. Y&#146;all come down on prices please.
        I&#146;ve heard a lot of complaints going around campus
        on this issue and some even refuse to patronize the
        place.</font></li>

    <li><font size="4">I&#146;d just like to let everyone know
        what services the health clinic in the Davidson center
        offers. It seems that the more students i talk to the
        more i realize that they are not aware of what you can
        get at the health clinic. For starters, you can get
        condoms for free. You can also get over the counter
        prescriptions for mostly a dollar. Dimetapp, Tylenol,
        cough syrup, antibiotic cream, sunburn cream, itchy stuff
        cream, aloe vera, and many more things in full size
        portions are available for a dollar. Vitamins are three
        dollars. In Walmart you are going to pay up to ten times
        the price for some of this stuff. The clinic has
        children&#146;s things available too. I have purchased
        them for my kids over the last year and had enormous
        savings. Students can also get all the girly tests done
        and see a doctor for all other ailments. The staff is
        very nice, friendly, accommodating and informative. They
        also assure confidentiality. You are paying a fee in your
        tuition for the health clinic, so use it to your
        advantage!</font></li>

<p><font size="4">This is a funny and romantic comedy set in
London in 1593. The plot follows the trials, tribulations, and
woman problems of William Shakespeare, a struggling young
playwright suffering from a terrible case of writer&#146;s block.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">No matter how hard he tries, he just can&#146;t
seem to make any progress with his latest effort, &#147;Romeo and
Ethel, the Pirate&#146;s Daughter.&#148; The title just
doesn&#146;t seem to fit, but William keeps writing. But then
Will meets and falls in love with the beautiful Viola. She is
extremely desperate to become an actor, and disguises herself as
a man to audition for his play.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Back in the day, women were not allowed to
perform on stage. But anyway, love-struck William puts his
creative juices to work and in turn we get the second greatest
love story ever - Herbie and that guy in the &#147;Love Bug&#148;
movie takes number one. Anyway, &#147;Romeo and Juliet,&#148; is

powerful gangsters. He&#146;s grown up in the Mob life and has
been well prepared for his future by Manetta, his mentor and

before. But when it becomes time for Paul Vitti to assume his
role as the leader of his crime family, he suddenly starts having
trouble breathing. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">He can&#146;t sleep; he&#146;s preoccupied
around his family; his mistress wants to know why his interest in
extra-curricular activities is decreasing, and his loyal goons
think he is losing it completely. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">If the other crime families find out that Paul
Vitti is having panic attacks, then how can he run his business?
Ben Sobol is a divorced New York psychiatrist with a young son
and a fiancée. He&#146;s a nice guy and a loving dad who&#146;s
plagued by his relationship with his own father, a highly
successful, media-seeking therapist. Ben doesn&#146;t want to be
anything like either of his self-absorbed parents.</font></p>
