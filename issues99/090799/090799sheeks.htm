            src="images/090799sheeks.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="184">	Did you know that there is a place on campus where you can participate in a cooperative education program, making money while gaining experience in the business world?  While you’re there, you can also design your resume, have it critiqued, then tailor it to fit the job you’re looking for.  While you’re at it, employees will be glad to give you information on the volunteer programs available in Columbus.  Are you curious yet?  Well, if you are, feel free to stop by the Career Center, located in the Davidson Center by the bookstore.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to Acting Director of the Career Center, Gina Sheeks, employment opportunities from the Columbus region come in every day.  “We certainly want our students to take advantage of the services offered. Our graduates are very fortunate right now; they’re going into a stable economy, unemployment is low, and many job opportunities are available to them.”  Recruiters have told Sheeks, however, that they will leave a position open rather than fill it with someone unprepared for the job.  In a world in which college graduates are becoming more and more common, employers are looking at much more than a student’s GPA.  Extracurricular activities, community service, and previous job experience are often the deciding factors in who gets a position.<br>
	Aside from offering the aforementioned services, as well as many more, to college students, the CSU Career Center provides the same services to its alumni.  “Most people change jobs at various points of their lives, and the Career Center is available to them during these transition periods.”  CSU is striving to “network more closely to the alumni in the area.”  Students can talk to alumni about their future careers, and spend time with the graduates who already have jobs.  “It’s a mentoring program,” says Sheeks.<br>
            <br>
	Lesa Kerlin, the former director of the Career Center, accepted a job offer from Truman University in Missouri as the school’s Director of Career Services.   “It was a very positive move for her,” says Sheeks, who is now acting director of the CSU Career Center.  Sheeks is “very excited” about her new job.  Before accepting the position, which she has occupied since August 16, Sheeks was an assistant professor of communication at CSU, a job she has held since 1992.  She received an undergraduate degree in journalism, with an emphasis on public relations from Murray State University and a master’s degree in organizational communication. At present, she is a doctoral candidate in Educational Policy Studies, with emphasis in higher education, at Georgia State University.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As acting director of the Career Center, Sheeks’ duties include supervising the services offered, working with individual students who are preparing for the job market, and speaking to classes to encourage the students to start job-search preparation early rather than waiting until their senior year.  “One goal I have is to try to bridge academic life with the student services division, because both are critical to our students’ success-the two areas should complement each other.”<br>
	Sheeks is enjoying her new position because, “in communication classes, I am equipping students with skills they’ll be able to use throughout their lifetimes.  [Working at the Career Center,] I hope to further enhance those skills by assisting students in preparation with their careers.”<br>
