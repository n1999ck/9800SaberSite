            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dear Staff,<br>
            <br>
            I’m writing in response to the anonymous ROAR column of last week. First of all, for a first week freshman, the writer seems to know the SGA staff intimately. And secondly, you’d better harden your sensitivity, if hearing an argument makes you stomp off and not participate in an organization. This is a u-n-i-v-e-r-s-i-t-y. Freethought and discussion is thoroughly encouraged.  The SGA has been most helpful, courteous and beyond reproach in the two years I’ve attended this school. It doesn’t deserve to be portrayed as you portrayed it. I have never walked into SGA for help and not been helped. It was instrumental in the forming of the Freethought Society on this campus. SGA was also responsible for help in other ways personally. Everyone should give that organization a pat on the back for being a credit to this university. I’m very proud of them.<br>
            <br>
            Sincerely...<br>
            (not anonymously)&nbsp;<br>
            Lisa Grant<br>
            President, Freethought Society&nbsp;<br>
            Senior Psychology</font></p>
            <hr noshade size="1" color="#3D117B">
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To Whom It May Concern:<br>
            <br>
	Since this semester has only been is session for approximately TWO weeks, SGA has not even had a meeting. Therefore, I think that instead of putting SGA down when they do have meetings, go to them. The SGA senator meeting is where everything happens. The president, vice president and the rest of the executive board members are not the ones to decide what happens for the students. Senators, the STUDENT REPRESENTATIVES, are the ones with the power. Nothing gets passed without their approval. What I do not understand is how you can bad-mouth an organization without even attending one meeting or getting to know the staff.<br>
	Before anything else bad is said, go to a meeting. Everyone is welcome. Students, you do not have to be a senator to join in the SGA meetings. SGA is for YOU!!! Get the FACTS before the GOSSIP starts.<br>
	As for the petty argument that the anonymous freshman wrote in last week’s paper, it was not a petty argument. The SGA president has a job to do, and he was doing it. Whoever you are, I am sure that when you went into the office, you did not even let the president or anyone else in there know that you were there. If you had, then the “Petty Argument” would have stopped. I am sure that when you have a job to do and you do not do it right or not at all if that is the case, then your boss sets you straight. They were hired to do a job and make sure that the workers underneath them do their jobs. I know that in the jobs I have worked in when I was not doing my job, I got into trouble for it with my boss.<br>
	SGA was invented for the students, and if students do not take part in this wonderful organization, then it is the students’ and the school’s loss. With the right involvement of students, senators and the SGA board, this Student Government Association could be the best one yet. YOU, the STUDENTS, can make it happen. SGA IS THE VOICE OF THE STUDENTS!!!<br>
            <br>
            Sincerely,<br>
            Elaine Cribb</font></p>
            <hr noshade size="1" color="#3D117B">
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On the behalf of the Student Body I would like to congratulate the SABER for the honesty of the past two issues of the student newspaper.  I think the SABER staff has done a wonderful job with the reformation of the student newspaper.  Student Government wants to take the opportunity to invite each and every single student to our first forum of the semester, which is September 9, at 12:30 in the Davidson Center Columbus Room.  Forum is made up of students that are elected to represent the entire student body, such as myself.  To all the individuals that have had faith in Student Government since the beginning we thank you.  We promised you that our main goal was to inform you of the ins and outs of this campus and that is a promise that we will keep.  Student Government would like to thank all the students who came out and supported us during our summer and fall cookout.  Our job is to help and that is what we strive to do.  Feel forever free to come and join us in Davidson 207, our door is always open.<br>
            <br>
            Eddie Gordon,<br>
            President of SGA</font></p>
