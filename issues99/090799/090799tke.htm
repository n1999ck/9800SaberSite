            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The recent advertising campaign of a campus fraternity has caused many students and faculty to question what is appropriate to post on the campus.</font></p>
            <p><img border="1" src="images/090799tke.jpg" align="right" width="250" height="307"><font
            face="Arial" size="2">Tau Kappa Epsilon posted flyers and banners around the campus last week advertising their annual Kamanawanalaya party. Sheet banners were hung up outside the Davidson Center and on the front of Howard Hall. Posters were also hung up throughout buildings on the campus.<br>
            The controversy stems from the scenes portrayed on the posters. The first set of posters that were displayed featured pictures of various women in bikinis and displayed the organization’s name and the location of the party. These posters were removed on Monday but were replaced with a scene of men and women, some in swimwear, with a man chasing a woman in the background and a man holding what appears to many to be an alcoholic beverage in the center of the picture.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Some females on campus have reacted to the ads saying that they portray a sexist attitude towards women. Many have also said that the ads may be encouraging things such as underage drinking and unprotected sex and could result, in an extreme case, in date rape becoming an occurrence at parties such as this that are advertised on campus.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Columbus State University student handbook states, under the section on Student Responsibilities, that “lewd, indecent, and obscene conduct and/or expression are prohibited.”  Dr. Terry Norris, Director of Judicial Affairs, stated that the handbook was not specific and was “open to interpretation.”&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A spokesperson from the Tau Kappa Epsilon National office, when told about the first posting of women in scantily clad clothing, stated that the members of the fraternity “could have used better judgement” in their advertising for this particular party.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Female faculty and staff were asked about their opinion on the advertisements. Reactions were mixed, with some saying that the posters may seem offensive to some but that it did not affect them in that manner. Others were more vocal in their opposition to the campaign.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Cathy Fussell, Coordinator of the Writing Lab stated that “if [she] was a female student on this campus, [she’d] have nothing to do with TKE as long as they exhibit this sort of immaturity.” She also stated that the members of TKE may want to “visit another campus to get some fresh ideas.”&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ann Rosenthal, Assistant Professor of Communications, stated that they teach their
            students “communicative competence,” which “entails a sensitivity to the members of an audience (community).” She said that she was “disappointed” that students did not seem to be relating this competence in this case.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When the TKE house on campus was called in regards to the questions that have arisen they stated that the party was “traditional” for their chapter and that they were “looking forward to people joining them.”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Omicron Tau chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon was founded at Columbus College on January 22, 1977 and now numbers over 250. The chapter is involved in many fund raising and philanthropic organizations including the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation and the Special Olympics.</font></p>
