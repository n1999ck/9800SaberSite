            face="Arial" size="2">A</font><font face="Arial" size="2">re you sick of hearing about Alcohol Awareness Week yet?  Yeah, I could understand why you would be tired of everyone talking about drinking responsibly and making sure you know what can happen if you drink too much.  I mean, do they think that we are incapable of drinking responsibly...I know how much I can drink and no one is going to tell me otherwise.  When I go out I want to drink as much as I can as fast as I can.  Do you think you can drink faster then me?  Well, let’s just go down to the bar and we will see who is the best.  Don’t worry...if you have a fake id they will let you in.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If this is the way you talk and think about drinking then I am scared for you.  We all know people like this...you know...they tie it on every weekend and run all over town until they have successfully made a fool out of themselves.  Their soul purpose is to get as drunk as they can as fast as they can, and they want everyone around them to do the same.  I wish I could tape record some of the things that these people say and play it back to them the next day.  It would probably sound something like this, “I am not drunk...you are looking at someone who can drink anyone at this party under the table (oh, you are so cool)...yeah, do want to challenge me...come on...why aren’t you drinking...come on man, have one on me...”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is usually followed by a series of loud screams and yelling and carrying on.  The more they drink the cooler they think they are.  Oh, and the topper is that they want to drive home.  Are you on crack?  Who the hell do you think you are trying to drive home in that condition?  What, does it make you a man if you can make it home so totally blitzed that you pass out as soon as you put your key in the door of your house?  This is the part of drinking that I will never understand.  Why in the world would you go somewhere and get to the point where you are telling people, “Take my drunk, I’m home,” and then try to drive.  This is not cool.  The mature and responsible thing to do would be to always have a designated driver.  If  you know that you will probably be unable to drive...don’t even take the chance.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I do drink and I have been known to drink too much, especially when I was a freshmen.  So, before you get offended let me set some things start.  I think that alcohol use is a normal part of college.  Everyone is experimenting and trying to fit in and do what they think is the popular thing to do.  We have all had our nights of over indulgence where we woke up the next morning and thought, “What exactly did I do last night.”  And hey, if you have never drank before then more power to you, but please don’t act all high and mighty about it.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Bottom line, drinking is a personal choice and one that most people in college make.  The problem is that after the decision to drink is made...not much thought goes into how much drinking will be going on.  We think we are invincible.  We are young and nothing and no one can harm us.  I bet some of you are reading this right now and thinking about how I am just full of it.  You don’t have a problem.  You can handle your alcohol and not harm anyone around you.  What am I talking about?  You are sick and tired of everyone getting all worked up about drinking.  We are responsible people...we can handle it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Can you handle a phone call in the middle of the night telling you that your best friend was just killed in an alcohol related accident?  Can you handle going home and telling your parents that you got a DUI?  Can you handle the look on the face of the parents who just lost their child because they were hit by a drunk driver?  Take a close look at that one because we all might be parents one day...maybe one day soon.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">What am I doing...have I gotten to serious on you?  Too bad, this is a serious subject and it is high time we took a good look at ourselves and evaluated our drinking habits.  I know that I have...and you know what, I didn’t like some of the things I saw.  I still drink and sometimes I drink a bit too much, but I always have a designated driver and most importantly I surround myself with people who care enough about me to tell me I have had too much.  The funny thing is that I didn’t think I could have fun without alcohol when I was a freshmen, but now I can go out and not drink and still have fun.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I am no different then you and definitely
            no better.  I am just capable of stepping back from a situation and evaluating it and maybe even correcting my behavior.  Some of you need to do the same before it is too late.  How much is too much?  Please don’t wait until until you have to learn the hard way that drinking can be dangerous and you are responsible for your own actions.  So, please...think before you drink.</font></td>
