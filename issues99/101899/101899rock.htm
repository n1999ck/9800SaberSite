            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	IT’S THE MOMENT WE’VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR!  That’s right!  The long anticipated greatest hits album by Chris Gaines was finally released on September 28, 1999.  Have you gotten your copy yet?  Have you reminisced as you listened to all the hits that made Chris Gaines famous?  This album is a compilation of his songs that we all know and love!&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	“What?” you ask.  You don’t know what I’m talking about?  Who is Chris Gaines?  What songs made him famous?&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Don’t stress yet, because these questions are perfectly normal.  If you’ve never heard of Chris Gaines, it’s because he doesn’t exist.  Although the album is real, Chris is a fictitious character created in order to allow an already famous musician to have a little fun and spend a little money.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	As interesting as it sounds, this is not a new idea.  David Bowie created and performed as Ziggy Stardust.  Bet you didn’t know it was really David Bowie, did you?  Do you know the real name of the man behind Chris Gaines?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you watch the video for “Lost In You” on VH1 or MTV and look very closely, you might be able to recognize the man behind the stylish black wig, suit, and pop-rock vocals.  In this dimension of reality, this guy is currently the most powerful and popular man in country music.  That’s right—Garth Brooks.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	 In his own manufactured reality, Garth has temporarily given up the “beer drinking, truck driving, womanizing cowboy” image to pursue a career as a pop singer.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The interesting part of the story is that Chris Gaines is already famous.  At least, that is what they want us to think.  Along with the character himself, Garth has covered all the bases by creating a history in music for Chris.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Included in his life are details like five previous albums that created Chris’ fame, the tragic death of his father, reconstructive face surgery after a car wreck, and remnants of an old band called “Crush.”  (To read more about Chris’ life, see the liner notes of his Greatest Hits album.)<br>
	The newly released album is the collection of all Gaines’ top ten favorites.  Of course, they are new to you and me.  Although Garth Brooks has scored one hit already on the present day pop charts with the Chris Gaines release of “Lost in You,”  that seems to be about the best he can do.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	After listening to the album, all the hype about this mystery singer really leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  With songs like these, there is no way that Chris Gaines could have made himself as popular as they want him to be, nor will he be able to do it now.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It’s unfortunate that the great G.B. has wasted his time and money trying to sound like a pop-rock singer.  It seems as though there is nothing to hide his bad grammar and country twang, especially in songs like “It Don’t Matter to the Sun.”   Although some of these songs are good, overall the album has a mellow mood and general country feel.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When you are a rich, bored country singer, what can you do?  Well, you can try to play professional baseball, and when that fails, you can create a fictional character in order to cross music genres.&nbsp;<br>
	Personally, I think that Garth should have invested all that money in the stock market.  I’m not knocking Garth’s creative talent, of course.  After all the top ten hits he has had on the country music charts, one doesn’t need to argue that he is a general in the musical army.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The part that is confusing, though, is that other country stars have crossed into pop music by themselves, without the aid of a fictitious character.  Reality is the best policy, they say.  Or something like that.&nbsp;<br>
	The point is, this is not Garth’s best.  It is obvious that he has done much better while living in reality and performing as Garth Brooks.  Noting that pop music is not Garth’s territory, he might sell some albums based purely on curiosity.  After all, I bought into the buildup and I do like one or two of Chris Gaines’ greatest hits.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	If you are planning to form your own opinion and check it out for yourself, “Garth Brooks as Chris Gaines.....Greatest Hits” is available at your local music store in both regular and limited hologram editions.&nbsp;<br>
	The next solo album to be released is called “The Lamb” and is due out sometime next year.  Oh, and the movie is soon to follow.   Chris’ biography states that the critics are calling it, “The definitive album of the new millennium.”  We’ll see.</font></td>
