        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The shock of Dr. Centa's death is still evident on campus.
        A memorial service was held Thursday night in the Davidson cafeteria as an informal forum
        for those who knew and loved him to speak about what he meant to them, tell funny stories
        and just reminisce. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">However, caring sentiments are not the only ones I've heard
        speak about Dr. Centa's suicide. In fact, I've been appalled at the lack of tact, empathy
        and understanding of many on campus.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Wednesday morning I heard several people in different areas
        of campus speaking loudly about their opinions on the subject and their opinions about
        atheists and suicide in general. Many expressed a poorly thought-out rationale that the
        world would be a better place if all the atheists on campus would, &quot;blow their brains
        out&quot;. This attitude, and especially the openness of sharing such a bigoted,
        compassionless point of view, shocked me. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As an atheist, I felt threatened by the small groups of
        people huddled here and there exclaiming their relief that there is one less atheist
        around. Many of these people proclaimed to be Christians. As I've stated, I'm not a
        Christian, but it is my understanding that Jesus taught tolerance and peace. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I heard people express the notion that because Dr. Centa
        was an atheist, there was no reason for him not to kill himself. I would like to clear
        that up also. As an atheist there is plenty of reason for me not kill myself. I believe
        this is it, one opportunity at life. I have my son, my family, my career, and my life as
        enough reason to keep me here. I can not explain what David Centa did, no one can. But
        atheism does not breed suicide any more than Christianity prevents it. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The fact is atheists are human beings that deserve the same
        respect as everyone else on this campus and in this country. The same sort of comments
        made about nearly any other group of people would spark outrage. Somehow many feel that
        those with differing religious views, or those without religion are free game. Many openly
        present bigotry against non-theists as an ideal not only to be accepted, but to be
        embraced. However, it is bigotry just like any other kind and it is hurtful and damaging. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Centa was a vehement opponent of the CSU creed. He
        cited many reasons for opposing the creed, but one main reason was that he felt the creed
        was unenforceable. He said to me on many occasions that it was impossible to demand that
        people respect each other and somehow enforce that they do so. It is ironic that if the
        creed could be enforced, these people would be held responsible for violating the code of
        the university. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I feel certain that if these people knew me or knew Dr.
        Centa outside a classroom, they would reconsider their views on atheists. That's not to
        say that they would take on an atheistic philosophy, but perhaps then they could see us as
        people. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Another person on campus expressed his opinion that since
        Dr. Centa committed suicide, he should not be memorialized. I agree that suicide is not
        the answer. I believe that the memorial held on campus was to ease the suffering of Dr.
        Centa's loved ones and not in any way a tribute to the act of suicide. Dr. Centa's actions
        will never be fully explained. However, we do not know what was in his mind. We can not
        even rule out a chemical imbalance in his brain or clinical depression. None of this
        changes the fact that to many, Dr. Centa was an important, loving person who should not be
        judged for one act in a lifetime of events. It is unfair to remember one moment in the
        life of a man who brought so much into this world. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We live in a country where we are supposed to be free to
        believe what we wish, to accept or decline any view, religion, opinion or idea. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I urge those students who had such harsh words this week to
        think about what they are saying before they speak. I would like to believe that these
        comments were made out of ignorance and flippancy and not out of hatred. Many of these
        students' voices were riddled with anger and contempt, while somehow worse, others were
        indifferent and apathetic. I watched Dr. Centa's daughter cry over the loss of her father
        Thursday night, and I believe most of these students would reconsider their views if they
        understood that Dr. Centa, atheist or not, suicide or not, was a human being.</font></p>
