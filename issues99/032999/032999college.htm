        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you&#146;re like most students, you&#146;re probably
        tired of classes in which all the professor does is lecture. Of course, not all lectures
        are boring, but a change would still be nice. What many people don&#146;t know, however,
        is that there is a wide variety of classes offered at CSU that include much more than
        lectures. Quite a few of these classes are open to everyone, no matter what your major is.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One of these interesting classes is CRUJ 2116, a criminal
        justice class called Victims of Violence. Instructor Dorinda Dowis, assistant professor in
        the criminal justice department, says that one of the aims for this class is to get away
        from the typical lecture format. Dowis&#146;s class, offered as an elective with no
        prerequisites, is usually pretty full with around 70 students. For extra credit, students
        participate in activities outside of the classroom. Once a month, students join VOCAL
        (Victims of Crime Against Leniency) meetings to show their support for victims of crimes
        such as spousal, child, and elder abuse, rape, and homicide. Last week, students could
        take part in Sexual Assault Prevention week activities. Dowis says &#147;[the class]looks
        at the plight of the victim, who is ignored and gets back into the limelight only as a
        witness or part of the prosecution&#146;s case.&#148; Dowis says, the textbook is
        &#147;easy reading, but packed with information.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Another interesting class students don&#146;t know much
        about is THEA 1315, Acting for the Non-Major. Steven Graver, the instructor, states that
        the goal of the class is to teach students &#147;the basics of acting: how to move on
        stage, theatre language, relating to each other on stage and to the audience.&#148; The
        class also focuses on building character and loosening up, which can be great for shy
        people. Graver recommends the class to people who have never had experience onstage as
        well as those who have had experience. Being in the class involves performing small scenes
        and playing theatre games that attempt to focus attention on body parts. Graver believes
        his students &#147;really seem to enjoy the class.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">ENGL 2147, Introduction to Film, is yet another unusual
        class offered at CSU. Just imagine, going to class to watch movies . . . Instructor
        Patrick McHenry says the purpose of the class is to &#147;study the history of film-making
        and the theories used to watch films.&#148; These movies can include anything from silent
        films, such as &#147;City Lights&#148; by Charlie Chaplin, westerns, film noir, which
        consists of dark scenery, nighttime scenes and anti-heroic heroes. This is also a chance
        for students to see independent films that are usually not shown at Columbus movie
        theatres. This class is small, with about 25 people, and students usually find the class
        very interesting.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you&#146;re looking for a class to fulfill the science
        section of your core, astronomy is a great course to check out. There are two courses that
        require no prerequisites, ASTR 1105 (lecture) and ASTR 1305 (lab), which are held at the
        Coca-Cola Space Science Center. Shawn Cruzen, the instructor of these courses says both of
        the classes are interesting, but the lab involves more hands-on experience. For instance,
        in the lecture, students learn how telescopes work, but in the lab, students actually
        learn how to use telescopes. In fact, one of the extra credit options for the class is a
        trip to Callaway Gardens with the Space Science Center&#146;s portable telescopes to
        observe the skies outside of the city. Cruzen explains that the astronomy classes are held
        off-campus so students have access to the facilities, which include a planetarium and an
        observatory.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Another class in the science area is Assistant Professor
        Jettie Lights&#146; &#147;Killer Germ&#148; class. BIOL 1125 examines deadly bacteria,
        parasites and viruses that threaten the human race. Not a class for the squeamish, Killer
        Germs includes films detailing the symptoms of flesh eating diseases and lectures on
        viruses, which inspired movies like &#147;Outbreak&#148;. The class, however, does not
        sensationalize the pandemics studied, rather offers a realistic view of the very
        interesting and scary microscopic world of viruses.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Finally, we come to the most unusual class of all&#151;art
        professor Donna Livingston hopes that this May will be the beginning of a new class called
        Topics in Art History: Contemporary Art in New York City. She hopes that, in the three
        week course, students will spend the first and third weeks in class, but the second will
        be spent in New York City. This is modeled after a class offered at Valdosta State
        University, and the cost will be under $500. If Livingston&#146;s plans work out, this
        course will be open to all students. Plans for the week in New York include attending
        plays and visiting museums, then writing a paper on what was learned upon their return to
        Columbus.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Registration time is coming up, so hopefully these classes
        have shown you that there is life beyond lectures. There are many other interesting
        classes&#151;just open up your academic catalog to find them.</font></p>
