Brian Hale
/ Entertainment Editor</font></strong></p>

<hr size="1" noshade color="#3D117B">

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Columbus has always been a strong catapult for talented
musicians, and I think we just found a new one.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Get used to this name - Seth Burnette. Seth comes from a
strong musical family and has loved music since early childhood.
His father and blues/rock musician, Gary Burnette, taught him how
to play electric bass when he was in high school. Today, Seth is
22 years old, and has been experimenting with electronic music
for nearly two years now. So where does he get it from?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Seth looks to his father as a strong influence, personally and
in his music. Seth also credits Brian Transeau with being an
influence to his music. &#147;He brings some heart and a sense of
the complexity of classical pieces to dance music,&#148; Burnette
said of Transeau. Seth also looks to Paul Van Dyke for musical
knowledge, because he &#147;is able to orchestrate songs that cry
out with emotion and feeling without the need for any vocalizing
lyrics to direct the listener.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">So all this being said, Seth Burnette appears to have great
potential. Then I listened to his album, and now I know he has
great potential. The working title for the album is &#147;Space,
Time, and Volume,&#148; and all of this is under the guise of
&#147;Casimir Effect.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I recently spoke with Seth and asked him what he thought his
album sounded like.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SB: &#147;I try to bring the beauty of trance and the dance
floor friendliness of breakbeat together, so that one track might
be nice to groove to while reading or driving, and the next might
force you to either put down your book and dance or drive faster.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">BH: Where did the name &#147;Space, Time &amp; Volume&#148;
come from?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SB: &#147;I was just thinking one day about how to mix two
different instruments together that appear in the same EQ
bandwidth, such as a kick drum and a deep bass line, without
interference or cancellation of either one. I was thinking that
they either had to be in different spatial locations relative to
the speakers (i.e., one panned left, the other center), timed
differently</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(as in kick, bass line, kick), or given distinctly different
volume levels to stand out from each other. Space, Time, and
Volume seemed to fit with the physics reference that &#145;Casimir
Effect&#146; was taken from.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ok, so Seth knows what he is talking about, and believe me,
listening to it is easier than trying to follow where it came
from.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Every musician has the dream of &#147;making it big.&#148;
Seth Burnette has what it takes to do just that. So, when he
does, what would he want to do then? So I asked Seth a question
that I was curious about.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">BH: If you were ever given the opportunity to play with a
famous musician, who would that person be?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SB: &#147;Tori Amos - because even though I&#146;d feel
musically inferior, she seems to be such a naturally talented
musician and all-around artist. I mean, that woman can really get
an emotion across.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">BH: What is your favorite track on &#147;Space, Time, and
Volume&#148; and why?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SB: &#147;My favorite track on my album right now is &#147;Curvature&#148;
because I feel I came close to achieving at least something
approximating beauty, and it&#146;s got a good groove.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Can we see Seth play live anywhere yet? Well, no, not yet.
But, on Wednesdays and Fridays you can go down to the Chickasaw
and request for the DJ to play Casimir Effect (or just &#147;Seth,&#148;
he&#146;ll know who you mean).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">For those who like to know a little about an artist before
getting into them, here is just enough to get you started on Seth
Burnette and &#147;Casimir Effect.&#148; Everybody has one, so I
asked Seth about his most embarrassing moment. He told me a
story: &#147;In second grade I was attending a new school, and
for Halloween I dressed as Dracula for the day (my old school let
us dress up on Halloween). To my horror I found, right as my mom
was dropping me off, that none of the other kids had dressed up
for the occasion. Needless to say, I didn&#146;t even get out of
the car. I made her take me straight home to change. I don&#146;t
think anyone actually saw me, but I was embarrassed nonetheless.&#148;
Oops.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">And to close this small look at Seth Burnette and Casimir
Effect, here is some stuff we should all know - his favorite food
is sushi, he&#146;s lived in Columbus since he was 5, he is an
only child, he is married to Stephanie Burnette, he works at
Wherehouse Music in Peachtree Mall right now, he really wants to
make it in the music business, and he would like to be involved
in getting a true dance music scene started here in Columbus (&#147;you
know, something with more than 10 people involved.&#148;)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">For those interested, a Seth has a flyer available at Riff&#146;s
with information about his music and his website. Seth can be
contacted at &lt;casimirburnette@mindspring.com&gt;.</font></p>
