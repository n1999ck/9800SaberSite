<hr size="1" noshade color="#3D117B">

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, hello again everybody. I hope your summer is going well.
For those of you reading this, I guess your summer could be
better - you&#146;re in school. But never mind that, let me tell
you what I&#146;ve been up to this summer. Concerts. That&#146;s
all I have really done. Rock and roll concerts, too. And I do not
mean rock and roll in general - I mean, bands that started rock
and roll. This summer has been a flashback as far as music goes -
in the same week, I saw Cher, Cyndi Lauper, L.A. Guns, Ratt,
Great White, and get this - Poison! Who knew the gods of rock
were still going strong?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">So anyway, I actually went to the Cher/Lauper shindig because
my favorite person (and girlfriend), Jenny, wanted to go. Of
course, I didn&#146;t tell her that is the only reason I wanted
to go. I kind of wanted to see Cyndi Lauper - I&#146;ve had a
crush on her ever since I saw the movie &#147;Goonies.&#148; So,
Cyndi was great - green hair and all.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lauper ran through a slower, more up to date sounding list of
a few of her more popular hits - &#147;Girls Just Want To Have
Fun,&#148; &#147;She-Bop,&#148; and &#147;True Colors,&#148; just
to name a few. After she was done, I was pretty much ready to go,
but the three ladies I was with came to see Cher - so I was
stuck. Thirty minutes and a rain storm later, Cher hit the stage
and breezed through a list of songs dating back as early as 1975.
The show, which was more of a dramatic performance, with costumed
dancers, theatric scenery and all, pretty much went in
chronological order throughout. The Jesse James song, &#147;If I
Could Turn Back Time,&#148; and her newest hit &#147;Believe,&#148;
were among a few songs she played. My personal favorite was her
own version of &#147;Walking In Memphis&#148;, which is less
popular than the Mark Cohn version.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">My point is - I&#146;m glad I stayed. I am truly convinced
that I saw a legend on stage that night.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now, on to the really good show. I made this trek without the
lovely Jenny. Much to her disadvantage, she was born in 1980, and
therefore does not truly appreciate good 80&#146;s rock and roll.
She&#146;ll learn - hopefully. And speaking of good 80&#146;s
rock and roll - a tour called &#147;Summer Jam&#148; is just that
- rock and roll. Four bands and five hours of music. L.A. Guns
hit the stage first, and they were pretty good. Pretty loud too.
They got people on their feet and dancing at 7:00 p.m. For a
concert in the daylight it wasn&#146;t bad. 8:00 p.m. rolled
around and brought Great White along for the ride. They were
impressive. &#147;Rock Me,&#148; and &#147;Once Bitten Twice Shy&#148;
were crowd pleasers and proved once again that rock and roll is
still cool.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nine o&#146;clock came pretty quickly, and Ratt came along
with it. It took 30 seconds for myself, and the people with me
(Jack and Sarah) to realize that not even a decade has made Ratt
any better than they were. So we retreated to the outer grounds
of Lakewood and waited. And waited. And waited. Ratt played
forever. Finally they finished. We then felt safe enough to go
back into the arena - all the bad music was gone.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">It was nearly 10:15 p.m. and time for the band of all bands to
play. It was time for Poison! All of a sudden, there they were.
Bret Michaels, C.C. Deville, Bobby Dall, and Rikki Rockett - the
original line-up, back together and better than ever. You name it
and they played it - &#147;Look What The Cat Dragged In,&#148;
&#147;Unskinny Bop,&#148; &#147;Every Rose Has Its Thorn,&#148;
&#147;Talk Dirty To Me,&#148; the Loggins and Messina song &#147;Your
Momma Don&#146;t Dance,&#148; and the Kiss anthem &#147;Rock and
Roll All Night.&#148; After nearly two hours of great music,
shiny clothes, big hats, and, did I mention great music, the show
was over. Just like that, as quick as it came, my flashback to
the 80&#146;s was over. But hey, there is good news! Poison is
working on a new album - yes, rock and roll is alive and well -
and the Scorpions and Motley Crue are playing Lakewood in August!</font></p>
