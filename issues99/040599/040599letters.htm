        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Editor,</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This letter is in response to a student&#146;s complaint
        regarding the pricing structure at the Howard Deli.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The pricing structure at the deli was based on a campus
        wide survey in which over 700 responses were received. The summary of those responses,
        which included a statistical sample of students, staff and faculty, showed that customers
        were willing to pay a little more for a superior sandwich.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The sandwiches made at the Deli are made on Fresh Baked
        Bread and include Healthy Choice Deli meats. In comparison to other delis, such as Subway,
        you will find that we put 33% more meat on each sandwich. In addition, we offer a choice
        of &#147;Real Cheeses&#148; such as cheddar, mozzarella and provolone. Subway sandwiches
        include processed cheeses in order to keep their food cost down.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In response to your plea, we will work on the development
        of both breakfast and lunch value meals. In the meantime, you may want to consider
        purchasing our Turkey, Chicken or Ham &#147;Deli Sandwiches&#148; and a Large Drink, which
        will cost only $3.68. Our French Bread Pizza is another great buy at only $2.98 for a
        Pizza and a Large Drink.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Columbus State University Dining Services are striving to
        please our customers. We are in the process of developing a Customer Comment Board, where
        comments can be posted along with responses from the Food Service Director. In addition,
        we are in the process of developing both a &#147;Dine with the Director&#148; Program and
        a &#147;Student Advisory Committee&#148;. The purpose of these programs is to open the
        lines of communications between Dining Services and the students, faculty and staff and
        propel our services to new heights. Please look for the advertisements regarding our
        upcoming programs and participate, because YOUR OPINION COUNTS.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Editor,</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Since October, 1998, there has been a Self-defense Club on
        campus. As the president of that club, I attempted to make a small splash in the water by
        offering information on rape and assault prevention, self-protection skills, and so forth.
        To my surprise, I received very little interest, with only about five CSU students and a
        couple of outsiders in regular attendance. After talking with Dr. Ivy Mallisham in the
        Counseling Center about being involved in rape awareness, and after discussing a possible
        joining of forces with the officers at Public Safety, I was also surprised to find that no
        one in these offices wanted to include the Self-defense Club in their activities.
        Interestingly, one of the CSU deputies told me that he would stop by one of the
        self-defense classes only if I offered free food!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When the Sexual Assault Prevention Week hit campus, I
        thought for sure that some new students would partake in the self-defense classes. After
        all, campus police was offering their own self-defense class, so people would probably be
        interested in learning more. I tried to get my foot in the door by talking to Rape Crisis
        of Columbus, Inc., and Dr. Robin Lee, but to no avail. At the self-defense class offered
        by public safety, we were told that it was not self-defense but &#147;survival
        skills&#148; that would be taught. I still cannot figure out what&#146;s the difference.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As many of you probably saw, the Self-defense Club entered
        the display contest for Sexual Assault Prevention Week. Many of you told me personally
        that you couldn&#146;t understand why the Self-defense Club didn&#146;t place first,
        second, or third. Many people on campus have told me that it&#146;s politics. The
        Self-defense Club is a little fish in a big pond, and it hasn&#146;t made a big enough
        splash to get noticed, so everyone&#146;s just looking the other way. What&#146;s funny is
        that I was even interviewed by the Saber about three weeks ago about the club, and the
        article has yet to be published. You know, I&#146;ve trained for some years in camouflage
        techniques; I didn&#146;t realize how good I was.</font></p>
        <p align="right"><font size="2" face="Arial">Dan Hall<br>
        President,<br>
        Self-defense Club<br>
        (706) 565-4281</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Editor:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">President Bill Clinton has authorized the U.S. military to
        engage in air strikes against a country with whom we are not at war, to end a centuries
        old ethnic conflict which does not threaten the United States, in a part of Europe in
        which we have no national self-interest. Why? Why are American soldiers being sent off to
        die in this Balkan wasteland?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Bill Clinton has answered: &#147;It&#146;s a moral
        imperative.&#148; The President&#146;s &#147;moral imperative&#148; is motivated entirely
        by the desire to sacrifice American soldiers as global policemen. The essence of his
        policy is, &#147;We have a duty to prevent any more atrocities from occurring precisely
        because we don&#146;t have a national interest in Kosovo.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Yet, a foreign policy that abandons our self interest is
        doomed to fail and can only result in tragedy. Already one U.S. plane has gone down and
        despite hundreds of sorties by U.S. and British fighters, Slobodan Milosevic has increased
        his assaults on ethnic Albanians. Milosevic knows he has nothing to fear from us. When our
        legitimate interests have been at stake, such as with Iraq and Osama bin Laden, America
        has demonstrated that it is only a paper tiger. Given America&#146;s past failures to
        defend its interests and the inherent sacrifices of the current action, the bombing of
        Serbia is doomed to fail.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">What is the solution? We must reject the sacrifice of
        American lives and declare that the United States exists for its own sake. We must return
        to the idea that our military exists to protect America - not Kosovar autonomy, oppressed
        Albanians, Kurdish rebels, or starving Somalians. We must immediately withdraw from this
        conflict, announce that our military will be used when only U.S. interests are at risk,
        and uphold this policy consistently. This is the only way to regain our credibility,
        protect America, and prevent such deadly mistakes in the future.</font></p>
