            <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
            <img border="0" src="../../images/inyourface.jpg" align="right" width="250" height="299">	Have any of you heard about what happened at the Georgia Baptist Convention this month?!  Well, I did and I am not pleased.</font>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">What happened?  Two churches, the ouster of Oakhurst Baptist Church of Decatur and Virginia Highland Baptist of Atlanta, were expelled from the Georgia Baptist Convention.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The convention has been in existence for 177 years and has never taken this course of action before.  So, you might be wondering...why were the churches expelled.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You are going to love this...they were expelled because they had homosexual leaders in the church.  I thought that churches were supposed to promote brotherly love and all that other stuff.<br>
	And to make it even more hypocritical...the convention says that it is ok to have homosexuals in the church but not leading the church.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Gerald Harris, president of the convention, stated, “I think the church has the responsibility to minister regardless of race or sexual orientation...but to be an ordained minister, it requires one to have a personal relationship with Jesus
            Christ...Homosexuality is not an acceptable lifestyle.  In order to be a believer, there must be turning from sin to turning to Christ.”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now, I am not the most religiously devote person...so I will admit that I am not well versed in the scripture.
            But.. what the hell!  Who does this guy think he is.  Did the almighty come down to the convention and say that these people were not believers because they are homosexual.<br>
	If a person has a strong enough faith that they want to become a minister or deacon or whatever, I say more power to them.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is one of the many problems in the church today.  They are so scared of change that anything different is considered a sin.  And don’t come back to me with that, “it says it in the bible” crap.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The bible is a guide and obviously one that is being abused by persons who want to bury and destroy anything that is unlike them.  Aren’t the scriptures supposed to be open to interpretation?  If  you want to start following everything that the bible says then ok.  Let’s do it...let’s sacrifice some animals or whatever else we stopped doing because society changed!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Can you imagine what would happen if Christians
            brought back the idea of sacrifice.  The animal rights people would have a field day.&nbsp;<br>
	I always thought that the bible’s interpretation changed as the years went on and the culture changed.  Last time I checked there was nothing in the bible that stated that you should spend a quarter of a million dollars on a church.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is simply an outrage.  What will be next...all those who have sex before marriage will be kicked out of the church.  Well, there goes some major membership.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is like the sins of those who fit into the typical “Southern” Baptist role are forgivable.  They forgive the teen who has a baby out of marriage, but only after they have made her feel like a complete whore, and they forgive the man who beats his wife because he is an alcoholic.<br>
	But...when faced with something that is increasingly becoming an acceptable lifestyle, they deem it a sin.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	In 1994, the Southern Baptist Convention issued an apology to black Americans for not welcoming them into their ranks.  So, was being black a sin...why weren’t they “welcomed” into the folds of the convention.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I have a theory...could it be because they didn’t fit into the stereotypical role of Southern Baptist lifestyle.  You know white, straight, and middle class.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">How does this convention even still exist if it is constantly alienating groups of people who believe in God and want to worship?&nbsp;<br>
	And if you want to debate me on this point then bring it on.  I am sick and tired of religious leaders appointing themselves the voice of our society.  Homosexuality is wrong...drinking is wrong...sex is wrong.<br>
	What is next...why don’t we all just close down all the dance clubs and after hours clubs.  Let’s all go to church and sit in the pews all dressed the same and listen to some guy who is probably wearing a teddy under his suit.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now hold on a minute...I am not saying that all church leaders are jerks like this Harris guy.  I have met many preachers who are loving and accepting.  People who are positive role models for future generations.<br>
	Churches have an enormous ability to influence people to live a good life and to be productive and happy.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">What happens when churches begin to condemn large groups of people because of their sexual orientation and lifestyle?  I will tell you.  To put it simply...they lose credibility.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If someone was trying to recruit me...a open minded, pro-choice, feminist to become a
            Baptist do you think I would be willing to listen.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">W</font><font face="Arial" size="2">ould they even want me?  They probably would want me for a little while and then the inevitable would happen.  They would discover that I have a mind of my own and will not conform and become one of the hundreds of thousands of mindless zombie followers of people who have seemed to lose the meaning of what they are preaching.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Situations like this give Christianity
            a bad name.  How many times have I heard people say...well at my church we don’t discriminate...we love everyone and include everyone.  So, there are places out there where people who don’t want to fit into the stereotypical Southern Baptist role can go.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The difference between us and them is that we have to put up with constantly being criticized for being open minded.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I am sure that many of you don’t like what I have to say and consider me a sinner for even thinking the way I do and that is fine with me.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I would rather be hated and condemned to hell for having a mind of my own then to be promised a day  heaven if I hate my fellow man.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To hate someone for things that you yourself don’t understand and can’t except is wrong.  Do I hate Baptists?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, if I did then I would hate my mother and father and my boyfriend.  There are plenty of Baptists, Methodists, Catholics, and whoever...that use their energy and influence to love all of mankind.  They don’t try and change you or treat you like there is something wrong with you if you think differently.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These are the people who I consider Christians.  People who live their lives in the warmth of God’s love...never judging...only accepting, even if they don’t understand or agree with what is in front of them.<br>
