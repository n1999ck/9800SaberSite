            Dear Editor,</font>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The students of Columbus State University should be appalled, alarmed and angry at the current organizational constitution that was passed in the past SGA forum on November 4, 1999.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The organization, Dugout Darlings, on the surface, I think is a wonderful idea.  The baseball team should have such moral support and add fighting spirit to the baseball team when things seem down.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	But there are certain things in the constitution of this organization as well as the fact that it passed in the manner that it did, bothers me severely.  Let me pull out the constitution here.  In Article II of the constitution, Object and Purpose, it states, “The object of this organization shall be to promote the Columbus State University Baseball Program to new recruits, local businesses and other organizations; to be involved in community works; and form a relationship with the Baseball Program and the student body”.&nbsp;<br>
	Doesn’t that sound wonderful?  That does sound great, now here comes the good part.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Article III, Members, Section 1, ELIGIBILITY, it states, “Membership in Dugout Darlings is open ONLY to student WOMEN of Columbus State University.  Membership may be obtained only by INVITATION”.&nbsp;<br>
	Now how does that sound to everyone?  As you see in the Object and Purpose of the organization, they are to PROMOTE the baseball team in good light, I presume, but why should there only be women in the organization if men are willing to be called a dugout darling, (because I do call my male friends darling, it must be the southerner in me, and it doesn’t seem to bother them) and are willing to support the baseball team.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The second thing that bothers me about that Section is that it states that membership is ONLY obtained by INVITATION.  Invitation?  Is this not an organization of Columbus State University?  Why should one have to be INVITED to join this organization if, as stated in the Object and Purpose, they want to support the baseball team?&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Even in a sorority, you are given a chance to at LEAST see what the organization is about during what is called open rush, so that you may show them your interest as well as they show you theirs.  If this is an organization on Columbus State University, you should be able to join if you are interested and committed to the cause, not be INVITED because someone wants you in the organization.  Even the Honor Societies on this campus like Lambda Alpha Epsilon, Chi Psi or Tri Beta, has a special organization for those interested in them, but aren’t able to due to grades.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Article III, Section 2, QUALIFICATIONS, it states, “The members of the Dugout Darlings shall be chosen for the ACADEMIC, MORAL AND SOCIAL WORTH that they display on and OFF campus.  A general knowledge of baseball is also required.  There will also be no romantic involvement with the members of the Baseball Program (including coaches, players, and trainers.)  Membership shall not be denied because of race, color, religion, national origin or handicap”.  		Well yeah, I agree, you should know just a teensy little bit about baseball so that if some baseball terminology is used, you know what everyone is talking about.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	But let me ask someone this, WHO decides what is moral or social worth?  Academic, moral nor social worth was not defined anywhere in this constitution.  What I define as morally correct is not morally correct to someone else nor would it be the same for what is socially correct.&nbsp;<br>
	I will admit if it weren’t for a few of my friends who dress me when needed, I will wear jeans and a T-shirt to a Broadway production or use my salad fork to eat my meal or a teaspoon (those REALLY long ones) to eat my cereal.  		Where are the DEFINITIONS?  What’s this about being romantically involved.  First off, you can have a roll in the hay and not be “romantically” involved and second off, who are you to tell me&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">W</font><font face="Arial" size="2">HO I can or cannot see on my free time on or OFF campus?&nbsp;<br>
	I am an adult and make my own choices, whether they be mistake or not.  		The last sentence of Section 2 must be an oxymoron!  How can you say membership will not be denied because of race, color, religion, national origin or handicap, if you HAVE to be INVITED and you must HAVE the correct WORTH of the populous at hand?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lastly, I would like to say, “Where was the representative of this constitution”?  Many people in forum had plenty of questions about this constitution and yet, there was no one there to answer any questions that anyone had.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I have been to many forums off and on the past few years and I have NEVER seen a constitution even go on the floor for a discussion or a vote without some type of representation !!!!!!  It was said by the President that the executive board represented this constitution, when asked where the representative was.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	My question is, did they really read it and consider the repercussions of some of the words in the constitution?  Or was there something else going on?  I am one to state an opinion when I think it should be said, but I am not one to gossip so I shall leave the statement at that, a statement.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	There was a motion for it to be tabled until the representative could come to an SGA forum and make her point and organization clear to the student body, but because it was tabled at a previous meeting due to the content that I have just described, it seems that some students wanted to go ahead and voted on it without any explanations at all.  The constitution was said to have passed by two-thirds vote, but it passed by 66% according to the math genius up front, not 67%.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If any student is as appalled as I am about this constitution or the things that seem to be going on in SGA, you should come to the next forum meeting and say what you have to say.  If you can’t make it to forum, the president says his door is always open.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	That’s what he says anyway.  Who else thinks this constitution shouldn’t have passed?  SGA is not just for representatives of organizations, but for ALL students enrolled on this campus.<br>
