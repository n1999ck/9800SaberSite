            <img border="0" src="../../images/inyourface.jpg" align="right" width="250" height="299"><font
            face="Arial" size="2">	Think before you speak...think before you speak...this phrase has resounded off the walls of my parents home for as long as I can remember.  This annoying, constantly harassing phrase is one that I never thought I would hear come out of my mouth.</font>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So many times our parents try and instill in us the values that they hold dear, and they expect us to uphold those values without questioning them.  As teenagers we are obligated to try and drive them crazy by not doing what they say.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	However, as young adults something happens and we change.  Suddenly we find ourselves actually listening and even following some of these ideas and values.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	What in the world is happening?  I can’t sell out and become like my parents.  The idea of agreeing with them would mean that they had been right all along.  Are you willing to admit that?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, eventually the time comes when you have to admit that sometimes your parents were right.  That time has come for me and I have to admit that my mom, and I don’t know how she did it, was pretty much always right.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Her big thing when I was growing up was to always think before you speak.  Didn’t make much since to me then...I mean I always think before I speak.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Since I have become an active person on the campus I have had an opportunity to be in situations where my words affected people.  This a big responsibility and you don’t realize the impact you can have.  What you say not only reflects on the issue at hand, but it also reflects on you as a person.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I have always thought of myself as a very polite, maybe even shy person who uses tact in every situation.  You can imagine my surprise the first time someone told me that I was not portraying this image.<br>
	I have the image of being a very assertive and dominating person.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">People sometimes find it hard to approach me about problems because they are afraid that I will chew their heads off.  Well, wait a minute...how did this happen?  Without even knowing it I have created a persona that I was not directly identifying with.  I had created a myth, if you will, that I was this sweet gentile person who everyone loved.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It has taken me a while to understand how my current image came into existence.  Bottom line, the way I talk to people is a direct reflection of how they perceive me.  I am a highly assertive woman...ok maybe I am a bit opinionated too.  So, naturally people perceive me as opinionated and assertive.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	But, it has only been recently that I have become comfortable with this image.  I have learned to manipulate and control this image by the way I address people.  In a sense, I think before I speak.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You see, thinking before you speak is not just about your choice of words.  It is the tone that you use and the approach that you take.  If you are a person that makes a strong stance about an issue and then are easily swayed by others, then you may be perceived as wishy washy.  You never stand by your own ideas and are too scared that others won’t agree with you.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The way you address others is also important.  If you are presenting an idea and want everyone to get excited about it...it wouldn’t make sense to act tired or bored.  Thinking before you speak includes so many factors.  The way you hold yourself and your tone of voice affect the persons listening to you.  Try smiling a bit and see what kind of reaction you get.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The content of your message is not necessarily the most important aspect of speaking.  We all know someone that we hate to hear talk.  Maybe it is because we don’t like their views or maybe they have an ugly tone in their voice.  		Whatever the reason, when they stand to speak there is almost an audible groan. I used to get that audible groan...</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">maybe I still do in certain situation, but the difference now is that I am aware of how I speak and I think before I speak.  I think about the way I am dressed and the smile on my face.  I think about who I am talking to and what they really want to hear.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I am comfortable in the fact that I am considered assertive, but the difference now is that I am aware of how to utilize this image to persuade others when I am speaking.  I always think before I get up and talk...but not just about the words.  Words are just black marks on a page.  When you create a style...a persuasive style...you bring a life to those words.  You give those words power.
