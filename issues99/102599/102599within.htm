            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	For every copy of this column that you cut out, xerox, and mail to one of your friends, the Saber is going to send you a check for $5.00.  I didn’t believe that it was true until I tried it myself and received a check in the mail for $482.69.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	How many of you just grabbed your scissors and rushed to the nearest copy machine?  Not many, I hope – and you know why?  Because you are not an idiot!  The Saber doesn’t pay me that much for writing this column, and you are definitely not going to get paid to pass it along.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I have found another bit of idiocy to rant about: stupid, useless, time-consuming e-mail messages!  I’m sure all of you have received at least one of these inane messages about Microsoft or Honda, because some knucklehead forwarded one to nearly everyone on campus.  I’ve got some news for that person . . . the check is not in the mail.  There is no way that Microsoft is going to send anyone a check for $800 for forwarding an e-mail message.   I’m sorry to inform you of this, but everything you read in e-mail is not true.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All of these messages begin with the same disclaimer:  “I am forwarding this because the person who sent it to me is a friend who does not send me junk.”  I’m sorry, nameless e-mail junkie, but your friend is a moron!  I would like to think that all of the people who forward these messages are complete brainless morons, but they are not!  I get this junk from my friends all the time, and I like to think that I hang out with people who are at least mentally competent.  In the last two weeks, I have received four of these messages:  three about Microsoft and one about how Honda is going to give me a new car if I torture enough other people with their e-mail message.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There is another kind of e-mail that drives me nuts.  When I returned from fall break, I had 31 new messages.  All but two of them were from the same 3 people, and they were all forwards containing sappy stories, bad poetry, or other worthless information.  I feel bad if I don’t read them, because every time I see one of these people, they ask, “Did you get that sweet story I sent you about the little girl who jumped off a 1000 ft. cliff and lived?” or some other similar nonsense.  If I say no, because I really deleted it before I read it, then I am sure to get another copy from the same well-meaning friend.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	All of these e-mails end with guilt trip-inspiring statements like these: “Within 1 hour you must send this message to 10 other people. If you do not send it, you will have once again passed up the opportunity to do something loving and beautiful and will continue the trend that gives you problems in your relationships. If you’re too busy to take the few minutes that it would take right now to forward this to ten people, would it be the first time you didn’t do that little thing that would make a difference in your relationships?”  I am not going to subject ten of my friends to these absurd messages, and I am sure that my decision to delete this cyber trash will not have an adverse affect on my personal relationships.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	The other type of e-mail messages that bug me are the ones that do not pertain to me.  For example, I, along with everyone else on campus, got a message about Sigma Nu’s Halloween party.  I am not involved in greek life in any shape, form, or fashion, so if I want to know what Sigma Nu is doing, I will read the bed sheets.  I also received an e-mail addressed to “All Members of CSUHA” ( the CSU Housing Association).  Last time I checked, I wasn’t a member of that organization.  Campus e-mail was not designed to provide free advertisement for every event that Joe Schmo has planned.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	When you get real junk mail, at least you use it to line your bird-cage.  You can’t even get those benefits out of useless e-mails.  E-junk mail has no practical purpose and it wastes my time and the time of the people who circulate it.  Of course, these propagators of fifth grade-style chain messages obviously don’t have very much to occupy their time.  So, for all of you e-mail-bandits out there, make sure the stuff you are passing along is worth reading.  Then, maybe I won’t get four copies of Santa’s message about how his third cousin Bubba Claus is taking over Christmas this year.  I’m sure that Santa and Bill Gates will forgive you for trashing a few of their messages, and it will certainly make people like me a lot happier.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">	I think that tolerance is wonderful, as long as it extends to all people and as long as it is practiced intelligently.  I’m not a proponent of narrow-mindedness, but I would rather be a little narrow-minded than to be so open-minded that all my brains leak out.  If we are going to be a tolerant society, there should be as much tolerance for the belief that homosexuality is wrong as there is for the belief that it is not.  If that isn’t the case, we are simply shifting from one form of intolerance to another, and that doesn’t seem like progress to me.  Maybe the best way for us to reconcile our differences would be to follow some advice about judging others that a teacher gave me several years ago.  He always said, “Sweep off your own doorstep before you try to clean up someone else’s.”  I think that would keep us all busy for awhile.</font></td>
